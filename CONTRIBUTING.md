# MS-UnconsciousBiasDetection

Welcome to the contributing guidlines for our unconscious bias detection system. The README file
has most of the necessary instructions to get the system up and running, however, this file
will be used to set the precedencct for how to contribute to the repository!!

## External Dependencies

Already stated in README.md, but it would be nice to have either one of these resources to
commit and push code.

- Git - Download latest version at https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
- GitHub Desktop (Not needed, but HELPFUL) at https://desktop.github.com/

# Making Changes to the Code/UI

To start off, NEVER make changes directly to the main branch without the approval of the developers.
Always start by creating a branch that details the functionality/change that is being attempted.

If you don't know how to make a new branch, the easiest way would be to click "View all branches",
then click "New branch".

## Commiting and pushing code locally

To commit and push code locally, make sure to always commit your code to the branch YOU are working on.

Commit to your branch at your own will (as there in no restriction on that).

## Pull Requests

After finishing your code on your main branch, make a pull request.

To do this, go to the "Pull Request" tab within Github, then click on 
"New Pull Request". After merging the branch of choice into the main branch,
click on "Create Pull Request" if you are allowed to merge. Make sure to 
leave comments detailing the changes you made before creating pull request.

Finally, click "Merge Pull Request" near the middle/bottom of the page, and
the developers will approve your merge request if it is valid and unproblematic
within the system.

## Conclusion

You have now merged your changes into the main branch, and your changes can
be visible from the commits to the main branch's history. If any more issues
arise, feel free to add more code to the system.
