1,,,"CSCE 331: Foundations of Software Engineering It is estimated that Windows XP has 50,000,000 lines of code"
2,,,The average mobile phone has over 10 million lines of code
3,,,"The average developer writes 10 – 20 useful lines of code per day, so a couple of engineers and 2 friends could break away, start a new company, and create a new “Windows” operating system in only about 1700 years"
4,,,That’s not reasonable
5,,,"Up until now, most of the programs that you have been asked to write could probably fit in your mind"
6,,,"When you complete the letter, you fold it, seal it up, and mail it off (or hit send)"
7,,,"But now it is plain to see that products that you use daily simply could not be recreated by you and 10 of your best friends in an afternoon, weekend, or semester"
8,,,A 1700-year project is wildly unreasonable
9,,,There must be a better way
10,,,"In this course, you will learn a better way"
11,,,"You will dive into the world of software engineering and hone your teamwork (and, yes, coding) skills"
12,,,"Effective teamwork is essential, and software design methodologies make development more efficient"
13,,,"This course gives you very practical skills for being an effective member of a development team and producing high-quality, sustainable software"
14,,,"Learning these methods of working together, managing requirements, producing quality software products, and testing, delivering, and maintaining these products is every bit as valuable as coding"
15,,,"Why This Course is Teach this Course This course offers you a unique learning experience, and is also exciting for the instructors to teach"
16,,,"Here's why! • Building software is fun and rewarding You get many opportunities to “learn by doing” • There’s more to software than just coding You get a taste of software engineering • Working on teams can be messy, but it’s worth it It is amazing what you can accomplish together, so much more than on your own Course Information Course Number: 331 Course Title: Foundations of Software Engineering Credit Hours: 4 (3 Lecture Hours, 2 Lab Hours) Lecture: Face-to-Face, MWF, 9:10 am – 10:00 am, Zachry Engineering Education Complex 350 Lab: • Section 904: Face-to-Face, MW, 3:00 pm – 3:50 pm, Zachry Engineering Education Complex 598 • Section 905: Face-to-Face, MW, 4:10 pm – 5:00 pm, Zachry Engineering Education Complex 598 • Section 906: Face-to-Face, MW, 5:45 pm – 6:35 pm, Zachry Engineering Education Complex 598 Final Exam Schedule: • Sections 904 – 906: Face-to-Face, Monday December 12, 8:00 am – 10:00 am, Zachry Engineering Education Complex 350 • Section 904: Face-to-Face, Tuesday December 13, 10:30 am – 12:00 pm, Zachry Engineering Education Complex 598 • Section 905: Face-to-Face, Monday December 12, 3:30 pm – 5:30 pm, Zachry Engineering Education Complex 598 • Section 906: Face-to-Face, Friday December 9, 7:30 am – 9:30 am, Zachry Engineering Education Complex 598 Instructor Details Instructor: Paul Taele Office: 320 Peterson Phone: 979-845-7977 E-Mail: ptaele@tamu.ed"
