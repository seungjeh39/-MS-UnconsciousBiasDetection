2,,,Monday 11:30 AM - 12:30 PM (PETR 214) Thursday 1:00 PM – 2:00 PM (Zoom ID: 97398779249 Passcode: 627171) The objective of this course is to make you familiar with the general architecture and the most critical components of operating systems
3,,,"You will leverage your knowledge acquired in your previous courses on Computer Architecture and Computer Systems to understand and implement aspects of operating systems, such as system calls, processes, memory management, scheduling, threading, synchronization, file systems, and I/O devices"
4,,,"We will cover general aspects, realization approaches, and case studies"
5,,,"In addition, we will implement extensions to the open-source Linux kernels and operating system libraries in the user space"
6,,,"Course Prerequisites CSCE 313 (and its corequisites CSCE312/ECEN350), CSCE 315"
7,,,"In particular, the course assumes some familiarity with low-level programming, some understanding of interrupts from a hardware perspective, and some practice with multithreaded programming and synchronization"
8,,,Special Course Designation This course has no special designation
9,,,"Course Learning Outcomes Upon completion of the course, students should be able to: • Describe the role, the architecture, and the major components of an operating system"
10,,,"• Describe the role and operations of kernels, system calls, exceptions and interrupt handling"
11,,,Course Syllabus Course Information Page 1 of 9 Course Syllabus • Implement a virtual memory manager for a paged system
12,,,• Describe and compare various forms of concurrency mechanisms
13,,,"• Describe and compare various synchronization mechanisms, both for single-processor and multiprocessor systems"
14,,,• Implement a threading system
15,,,• Implement a simple file system in the user space
16,,,Textbook and/or Resource Materials Textbook: Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces by Remzi and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau
17,,,This book is available for free at: https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP
18,,,"Grading Policy This course will adopt the following grading scale: A = 90-100 B = 80-89 C = 70-79 D = 60-69 F = <60 The grading will be based on textbook discussion, midterm and final exams, and projects"
19,,,The weights of the activities and the correspondent policies are as follows: Activity % Policies Midterm Exams 35 Three midterm exams will be taken through the duration of the course
20,,,The exams will be based on the operating system concepts discussed in class
21,,,"All the exams will be in-person, closed-book exams"
22,,,The materials covered in each exam will NOT be accumulative; the same topics will not be covered in two exams
23,,,Students are allowed to bring a double-sided A4-size note to the exams
24,,,The highest score of the three exams will be worth 15% of the semester grade
25,,,The scores of the other two exams will each be worth 10% of the semester grade
26,,,Projects 60 Six projects will be finished through the duration of the course
27,,,No team submission is allowed; students must submit their projects individually
28,,,The three highest scores of the projects will each be accounted for 12% of the semester grade
29,,,The scores of the other three projects will each be accounted for 8% of the semester grade
30,,,Page 2 of 9 Course Syllabus Collaborative Note Taking 5 Students can share lecture notes to gain extra points for the semester
31,,,Each student must submit an independently taken note for one course lecture to gain 0.5
32,,,of the semester grade
33,,,The maximum points each student can gain from sharing notes is 5%
34,,,Each note submitted must be complete and well-organized
35,,,Notes of poor quality will be returned by the instructor
36,,,"To be counted toward semester grade, the note must be shared through the google drive within one week (7 days) from the lecture given, before 11:59 PM"
37,,,"Late Work Policy Each student is allowed with at most 3 free late days throughout the whole semester, without any late submission penalty"
38,,,Students can use the free late days on any project and must specify the free late days used when submitting a project
39,,,"Without any free late days, a student will receive 20% penalty for each extra late day used on a project"
40,,,"For example, if a student has submitted a project three days after its deadline, and the student has specified to use exactly one free late day, the student will receive 40% penalty on the score of the project"
41,,,No late day is allowed for collaborative note taking
42,,,All notes must be submitted within 7 days after the lectures (before 11:59 PM)
