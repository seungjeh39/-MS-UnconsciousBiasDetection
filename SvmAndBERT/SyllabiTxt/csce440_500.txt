page 1 of 5 syllabus csce 440/640 course information course number: csce 440/640 (klappenecker) course title: quantum algorithms time: tr 9:35 am – 10:50 am location: hrbb 113 credit hours: 3 instructor details instructor: andreas klappenecker office: zoom e-mail: klappi at cse.tamu.edu office hours: wf 10:30 am – 11:30 am , all office hours will be held on zoom course description and prerequisites this course gives a self -contained introduction to quantum algorithms, one of the most exciting recent developments in computer science. we do not expect any background knowledge in quantum computing nor in quantum physics. you should know how to multiply a matrix with a vector, but the most important prerequisite is simply an open mind. course learning outcomes at the end of this course, students should understand the basics of the quantum circuit model, be able to understand fundamental quantum algorithm s, and ways to protect quantum information. textbook and resource materials required : p. kaye, r. laflamme, and m. mosca: an introduction to quantum computing, oxford, 2007 (reprinted 2010). recommended (for a more in depth study): m. nielsen and i. chua ng: quantum computation and quantum information, cambridge university press, 2011. resou rces: https://canvas.tamu.edu (check daily for updates) page 2 of 5 grading policy your grade will be based on the following components: - midterm exam 30%: the exams will be given in class . - final project 40%: you will have to write a term paper and record your presentation - homework and exercises 30%: th is is a mix of online questions and essay style assignments, for which you are required to use the latex typesetting system to type in your answers. all assignments can be found in canvas . your lowest homework grade will be dropped. csce 640 students will be expected to solve some slightly more challenging homework problems. final grades will be assigned according to this scale: a: 90 and above, b: [80,90), c: [70,80), d:[60,70), f: below 60 a slight curve might be applied if the course average is low. late work policy • all assignments must be submitted on canvas . • no late submissions will be accepted. • e-mail submissions will not be accepted and will be ignored without notice. • work turned -in on time is eligible for partial credit . • work submitted by a student as makeup work for an excused absence is not considered late work and is exempted from the late work policy. (see student rule 7 .) regarding policy a student can request r egrading of any graded material if the student believes that the points assigned are inconsistent with the quality and merits of the submitted work. to request re -grading the student needs to follow the guidelines below: 1. regrading requests must be submitt ed to the instructor within one week after the graded item has been returned to the student. after this time limit no regrading requests will be honored. 2. regrading requests must be in written form, accompanied by a reasonable amount of specific justificat ion and documentation. page 3 of 5 course schedule tentative course schedule: week 1 ( 1/18-) introduction , quantum cryptography week 2 ( 1/24-) quantum gates week 3 ( 1/31 -) quantum circuits week 4 ( 2/7-) quantum search week 5 ( 2/14-) quantum counting week 6 ( 2/21-) simon’s algorithm week 7 ( 2/28) midterm (3/1), factoring week 8 ( 3/7-) factoring week 9 ( 3/15) spring break week 10 ( 3/21-) quantum complexity week 11 ( 3/28-) quantum communication week 12 (4/4-) quantum codes week 13 (4/11-) fault tolerance week 14 (4/18-) project presentations week 15 (4/26-) project presentations exam and final project midterm exam : thursday, march 1, in class final project: the final project consists of writing a term paper and a presentation. reviewing the work of others will be expected as part of the final project. lectures and more all course information can be found on canvas . in your csce 4 40/640 section on canvas , navigate to the “lectures and more” tab on the sidebar for the most important information concerning lectures, quizzes, exams, reading assignments, etc. you should also check your course announcements daily . it is strongly recommended that you keep up wit h the course material and do not fall behind. start working on assignments as soon as they are assigned.
