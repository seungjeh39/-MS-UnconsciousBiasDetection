(2) interview trips that got scheduled at the last moment, etc. note that this is not an exhaustive list. all make up exams, if given, will be dif ferent from the original exam. instructor may choose to give an oral exam instead of a written exam. course schedule topics: 1. computational learning theory: sample complexity , version space, p ac learning, vc dimension, mistake bound, cross-validation 2. neural networks: perceptrons, multilayer perceptrons, backpropagation, gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, optimizers, deep neural networks (convolutional networks, recurrent networks, attention) 3. decision tree learning, support vector machines, 4. dimensionality reduction: pca, factor analysis, multidimensional scaling, isomap, locally linear embedding 5. genetic algorithms, neuroevolution 6. unsupervised learning and local models: competitive learning, k-means, adaptive resonance theory , self-organizing maps, radial basis functions, regression, learning vector quantization. 7. bayesian learning: maximum likelihood, minimum description length, bayes optimal classifiers, naive bayes classifiers. bayesian belief network, em algorithm. 8. biologically motivated models. 9/15/22, 3:44 pm syllabus for 22 spring csce 421 machine learning (sections 200/500) https://canvas.tamu.edu/courses/137553/assignments/syllabus 5/11 schedule (rough): see canvas homepage for reading and more up-to-date info. homework dues may change. weektuesday thursday topic announcementsdues (tentative)comments 1 1/18/2022 1/20/2022 introduction1/16: mlk day 2 1/25/2022 1/27/2022supervised learning concepts1/24: last day for add/drop 3 2/1/2022 2/3/2022neural networkshw1 announced 4 2/8/2022 2/10/2022neural networks 5 2/15/2022 2/17/2022reinforcement learninghw2 announced hw1 due 6 2/22/2022 2/24/2022reinforcement learning 7 3/1/2022 3/3/2022decision tree learning 8 3/8/2022 3/10/2022midterm exam (in class: thu)hw3 announced hw2 due3/7: midsemester grades due 9 3/15/2022 3/17/2022 spring break 10 3/22/2022 3/24/2022dimensionality reduction 11 3/29/2022 3/31/2022bayesian learninghw4 announced hw3 due 12 4/5/2022 4/7/2022bayesian learning 13 4/12/2022 4/14/2022 local models4/15: reading day 14 4/19/2022 4/21/2022 deep learning4/19: last day for q- drop 15 4/26/2022 4/28/2022 deep learning (thu is lasthw4 due 4/28: last class 9/15/22, 3:44 pm syllabus for 22 spring csce 421 machine learning (sections 200/500) https://canvas.tamu.edu/courses/137553/assignments/syllabus 6/11class) 16 5/5/20225/5(thu) : final exam 12:30pm- 2:30pm5/3: redefined day (meet friday classes) optional course information items all homeworks and programming assignments will be in the form of google colab notebooks (use tamu netid to login to colab). all submissions will be made through canvas.
