human-computer interaction - csce 436 (spring 2022) seminar + studio combined class. in this class, you will learn various details of cutting-edge technologies and prototyping techniques to make tangible computers for human-computer interaction. this class intends to provide a general understanding of hci theories, design principles, design & implementation techniques, then to offer fundamental skills for prototyping to investigate users’ needs in product/system development. learning outcomes with the focus on a broad spectrum of technical hci, student will be able to describe (1) fundamental hci principles and how they support the process of the new technology development, (2) the process of hci research from need finding to user evaluation, and develop (4) prototypes of digital/physical artifacts using machines and tools– skill acquisitions for effective communication. instructor jeeeun kim ( http://jeeeunkim.com/ ) email: jeeeun.kim@tamu.edu office hours: friday 10 am-12 pm petr 336 or via zoom (tamu.zoom.us/my/jeeeunkim), otherwise by appointment. teaching staff nahyun kwon (ta, co-instructor) email: nahyunkwon@tamu.edu zoom link: https://tamu.zoom.us/j/7647927393 (979-422-1648) office hours: tuesday 5 pm - 7 pm, via zoom or by appointment. han zhang (grader) email: zh89118877@tamu.edu himani deshpande (co-instructor) email: hdeshpande11@tamu.edu abul al arabi (co-instructor) email: abulalarabi@tamu.edu logistics f2f, synchronous if you have tested positive for covid or need quarantine, please email the instructor, the class zoom link will be provided to attend immediately. zoom recording of the lecture will be available through canvas momentarily. class time: wednesday 4:10pm - 6:50pm (we will start at 4:15pm for people who need some time for relocation) course website for questions, assignments, activities, midterm/final submissions, communications: https://csce436spring22.slack.com grading policies scale 90-100 a 80-89 b 70-79 c 60-69 d <60 f weight participation (class participation): 10% assignments + in-studio activities (individual, unless specified): 30% midterm project* (group project): 30% final project* (group project): 30% *project grading will be partly peer-reviewed (50%), and grader/ta graded. breakdowns will be provided in the class slack ( csce436spring22.slack.com) & canvas no written exam, no quiz deliverables assignment (individual)t: hci observation activities, interactive system design/prototyping practices, evaluation techniques, peer-review critiques submit through the slack for open curation . always due by tuesday 11:59 pm (ct) of the following week, unless specified. midterm 1: youtube video on the deployment of your flipped affordance final project: prototype of your own interactive system/machine invention 1. project website showcasing your work; ■ introduction and motivation: what important real-world issue does this solve? ■ descriptions of system design/development processes ■ photos of your prototype ■ video of your usage scenario (walkthrough) 2. presentation of your final project requirements ● no prerequisite, i welcome all students with various backgrounds (cs/ce, ee, me, architecture, design, material science, etc.) ● there will be a random selection of class activity presenters, if you miss the class so miss the presentation without notice, your final grade will be downgraded by one letter grade ● always bring something to sketch with ● no texting/facebooking/instagramming during the class -- no exception ● be ready for heavy hands-on studio activities and projects; you will be likely to spend 3+ hours/week ● this class will introduce a wide variety of topics in rapid prototyping and late-breaking interaction technologies with very quick turnarounds. you don’t need to be a geek, but you should become a fast learner: acquire new skills and self-advance to the (semi)expert level with your investment. ● bring your own passion and motivation-- this course will help you build your portfolio & research experiences with quality, not your course credits with quantity reading week 1: ■ reflective physical prototyping through integrated design, test, and analysis (uist’06) by björn hartmann, scott r. klemmer, michael bernstein, leith abdulla, brandon burr, avi robinson-mosher, jennifer gee week 2: ■ how bodies matter: five themes for interaction desig n (dis’06) by scott r. klemmer, björn hartmann, and leila takayama ■ organic user interfaces & tangible interfaces (communications of acm) by roel vertegaal, ivan poupyrev, hiroshi ishii week 3: ■ user centered design process by mit csail hci ■ needfidning tools by stanford d. school week 4: ■ integrating craft materials and computation by glenn blauvelt, thomas wrensch, michael eisenberg ■ middle tech: blurring the division between high and low tech in education by michael and ann eisenberg week 5: ■ creativity support tools by ben shneiderman week 6: ■ what do prototypes prototype?
