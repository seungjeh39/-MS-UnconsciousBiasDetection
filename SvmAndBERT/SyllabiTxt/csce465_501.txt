networking; privacy; and policy . a secondary objective is to provide a working knowledge of topics such as cryptography , privacy , network security , and infrastructure management, so that students can acquire the necessary background for more advanced security courses. by the end of this course, students will be able to reason about systems from the perspective of a security engineer . that is, they should be able to deﬁne the system to protect; determine the security properties that are desired for this system; identify the possible threats to these security properties, and their likelihood of occurrence; and consider possible mitigations against these threats. textbook and/or resource materials required t extbook introduction to computer security , by michael goodrich and roberto t amassia, addison-w esley pearson, isbn-10: 0-321-51294-4 optional t extbook handbook of applied cryptography – available online at: http://cacr .uwaterloo.ca/hac/ (http://%20http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/) grading policy homeworks: 550 points (distributed across 6 homeworks). y our assignments must be typed and in pdf format. submit assignment to gradescope (https://www .gradescope.com) you are encouraged to discuss concepts with others, but you must do all assignments by yourself unless specifically instructed otherwise. if you refer to any source while doing your homework, you must give credit in your solution, (this holds true whether it be a person, paper , book, solution set, web page or whatever). y ou must write up the assignments in your own words. never copy someone else’ s words and turn them in. for example, “the academic integrity policy on this syllabus was based on one obtained from prof. jennifer w elch”, or “sally smith walked me through the solution to #38 and then i did #39 on my own” (assuming #38 was not on the homework). midterm exam: 200 points final exam: 250 points 1/13/22, 10:29 am syllabus: 22 spring csce 465 501: comp & net security https://canvas.tamu.edu/courses/129614/pages/syllabus 3/8a >= 900 points b = 800-899 points c = 700-799 points d = 600-699 points f = <600 points we will make an ef fort to complete the grading of work within one week of the turnin date. if you believe your work was graded incorrectly or incompletely , you must either 1) meet with a t a within one week of the date the work is returned, or 2) submit a regrade request in gradescope within one week (when applicable). only if you can prove to the t a that your solution is correct and complete will your work be regraded. late w ork policy late homeworks are not accepted and are worth 0 points. if you have an extended excused absence (per rule 7) that prevents you from completing a homework, please coordinate with the professor as soon as possible for a make-up. version control you are strongly encouraged to use a version control system to track changes and back up your work. t exas a&m has an institutional github account (https://github.tamu.edu) that you can use. do not create public repositories containing your assignment solutions as this may lead to unauthorized copying of your work and a violation of the aggie code of honor . course schedule week topic required reading 1 (jan 19,21)introduction security properties and principles security vocabularysyllabus gt ch. 1 thompson paper 1/13/22, 10:29 am syllabus: 22 spring csce 465 501: comp & net security https://canvas.tamu.edu/courses/129614/pages/syllabus 4/82 (jan 24,26,28) os security program vulnerabilitiesgt ch. 3 https://www .scmagazine.com/home/security- news/feds-charge-14-with-making-atm- cashouts-appear-like-one/ (https://www.scmagazine.com/home/security- news/feds-charge-14-with-making-atm-cashouts- appear-like-one/) alephone paper 3 (jan 31, feb 2,4)program vulnerabilities hw 1 due mon jan 311.8 2.1-2.2 4 (feb 7,9,1 1)program vulnerabilities crypto-symmetricgt ch. 8.1 5 (feb 14,16,18) crypto-symmetric vs. public gt ch. 8.5, 8.2 6 (feb 21,23,25)crypto-hash functions and signatures, pki hw 2 due mon feb 21gt ch. 8.3-8.4 7 (feb 28, mar 2,4)malware midterm exam - w eds march 2gt ch. 4 8 (mar 7,9,1 1)network security – tcp/ip , udp, nat hw 3 due mon mar 7gt ch. 5 march 14-18 spring break 9 (mar 21,23,25)network security – dns, firewalls, vpngt ch. 6.1-6.4 10 (mar 28, 30, wireless security gt ch. 6.5 1/13/22, 10:29 am syllabus: 22 spring csce 465 501: comp & net security https://canvas.tamu.edu/courses/129614/pages/syllabus 5/8apr1) web security hw 4 due w ed mar 30gt ch 7 11 (apr 4,6,8) web security gt ch. 7 12 (apr 1 1,13) april 15 - no classsecurity models hw 5 due w ed apr 13 gt ch. 9 13 (apr 18,20,22) distributed security gt ch. 10 14 (apr 25,27,29)physical security hw 6 due w ed apr 27gt ch. 2 15 (may 2)review last day of class is mon may 213.4, 13.5 final exam date: (from registrar's website (https://registrar.tamu.edu/courses,-registration,- scheduling/final-examination-schedules#6-may5(thursday)) ). section 501: may 5, 10:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m.
