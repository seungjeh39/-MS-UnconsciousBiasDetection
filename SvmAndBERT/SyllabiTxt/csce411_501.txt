(recall that your lowest homework assignment will be dropped.) tests. no make-up tests will be given. if a student needs to be absent from class on a test day due to an unavoidable and acceptable excused absence, that student needs to get approval from the instructor in advance. the absence must be acceptable as defined by tamu’s policy and will require formal verification (e.g., a doctor’s note). if any tests are missed, the final grade will be computed using the weighted average of remaining assignments in the course (which includes other tests, homework assignments, and quizzes). homework policy although it is not required, you are encouraged to work on and complete all homework assignments on your own without consulting peers or outside sources. course syllabus page 3 of 7 you are allowed, under a very specific set of guidelines, to consult outside sources and discuss homework problems with other students. however, the write-up must be entirely in your own words—copying is strictly prohibited and can result in
