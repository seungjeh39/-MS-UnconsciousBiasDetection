(see student rule 7 .) regr ading policy a student can request regrading of any graded material if the student believes that the points assigned are inconsistent with the quality and merits of the submitted work. to request re -grading the student needs to follow the guidelines below: 1. regrading requests must be submitted to the instructor within one week after the graded item has been retu rned to the student. after this time limit no regrading requests will be honored. 2. regrading requests must be in written form, accompanied by a reasonable amount of specific justification and documentation. page 3 of 5 course schedule the tentative course sc hedule is as follows: week 1 ( 1/18 -) introduction , review of asymptotic analysis week 2 ( 1/24 -) lower bounds week 3 ( 1/31 -) divide and conquer week 4 ( 2/7-) divide and conquer week 5 ( 2/14-) greedy algorithms week 6 ( 2/21-) dynamic programming week 7 ( 2/28 -) midterm (3/1), amortized analysis week 8 ( 3/7-) graph algorithms week 9 (3/14 -) spring break week 10 (3/21 -) graph algorithms week 1 1 (3/28 -) randomized algorithms week 1 2 (4/4-) randomized algorithms week 1 3 (4/11 -) np completeness week 1 4 (4/18 -) np completeness , approximation algorithms week 1 5 (4/25 -) undecidability , review exams all exams will be given in class . midterm exam : tuesday , march 1, in class final exam : thursday, may 5, 3:00 pm – 5:00 pm, in our class room lectures and more all course information will be given in class. important messages will be posted in canvas. you should check your course announcements , course material and due dates daily . it is strongly recommended that you keep up with the course material and do not fall behind. start working on assignments as soon as they are assigned.
