for this course reflects your mastery of course material and is determined by multiple components. as a writing course, you must pass the writing components with a c or better to earn a grade in the course. failure to pass the writing components with a c or better results in an f for the course. 1/17/22, 4:30 pm syllabus: 22 spring csce 315 908-91 1,970: programming studio https://canvas.tamu.edu/courses/136192/pages/syllabus 5/11team projects – 40%: two major projects, each worth 20% of the course grade, for 40% total. specific grading practices for each project will be announced when that project is given out. y our individual contribution determined from logged code commits, peer evaluation, and instructor/t a observations will be a significant contributing factor to these project grades. individual project – 5%: the individual project will be completed prior to the team projects. specific grading practices will be announced when the assignment is given out. written elements – 35%: this is a writing intensive course. y ou are required to pass this component with a c or better to earn a grade in the course. y ou will have several written assignments within the projects (roughly 10% from the individual project, 12% from the first team project, and 13% from the second team project). specific grading practices will be announced when each assignment is given out. other course activities – 20%: the course has several dif ferent types of activities to help you better understand concepts and connect with the material. this includes (but is not limited to) at- home activities, in-class activities, and lab activities. these activities bring deeper , longer-term learning as you work, either individually or with other students. for submitted assignments, grading will be based on the quality of the submitted work. for group assignments, your full participation is required to receive a grade for that assignment . this component will be divided as follows: 10% in-class activities (lowest grade dropped), 5% lab activities (lowest grade dropped), 3% at-home activities, and 2% in-class knowledge checks (lowest two grades dropped). grading scale: grades will be assigned according to the following scale: a >= 90 > b >= 80 > c >= 70 > d >= 60 > f these grades represent varying degrees of achievement (see the university's grading system (https://registrar.tamu.edu/transcripts-grades/grades#0-gradingsystem) ): a = excellent, b = good, c = satisfactory , d = passing, f = failing stacked honors section: the stacked honors section will explore course concepts more deeply through readings, discussions, reflections, and projects. they will have honors-only lecture sessions on the first friday of each month. submission of assignments: all assignments will be turned in electronically though canvas (https://canvas.tamu.edu/) (unless otherwise specified) by the due date and time given on the assignment. email submissions will not be accepted. late work policy 1/17/22, 4:30 pm syllabus: 22 spring csce 315 908-91 1,970: programming studio https://canvas.tamu.edu/courses/136192/pages/syllabus 6/11assignments turned in after the posted deadline will have a penalty applied of 5% per day late. for team assignments, the late penalty af fects the grade for the entire team. if the assignment is individual, the late penalty only af fects the grade for that team member . course schedule the course is listed as a 2-hour per week lecture, and 2-hour per week lab, however it has been intentionally scheduled for 3 hours per week of lecture (along with the lab). w e will meet approximately 2/3 of the lecture periods over the course of the semester . after the first week of class, the regular sections will only meet on mondays and w ednesdays with fridays reserved as optional workdays. the honors section will also meet the first friday of each month for deep dive discussions. below is the planned but tentative schedule of topics and major projects for the course. all assignment and project details will be communicated on canvas (https://canvas.tamu.edu/) . weeklecture t opics lab t opicsproject
