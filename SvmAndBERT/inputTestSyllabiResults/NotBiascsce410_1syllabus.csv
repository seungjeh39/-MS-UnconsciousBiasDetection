 Office Hours : Monday 11:3 0 AM - 12:30 PM (PETR 214) Thursday 1:00 PM – 2:00 PM (Zoom ID: 97398779249 Passcod e: 627171) Course Description The objective of this course is to make you familiar with the general architectu re and the most critical components of operating systems
You will leverage your knowledge acquired in your previous courses on Computer Architecture and Computer Systems to understand and implement aspects of operating systems, such as system cal ls, processes, memory management, scheduling, threading, synchronization, file systems, and I /O devices 
We will cover general aspects, realization approaches, and case studies
In addition, we wi ll implement extensions to the open -source Linux kernels and operating system libraries in the user space
• Describe the role and operation s of kerne ls, system calls, exception s and interrupt handling
Course Syllabus Page 2 of 9 • Implement a virtual memory manager for a paged system
• Describe and compare various forms of concurrency mechanisms
• Describe and compare various synchronization mechanisms, both for single -processor and multiprocesso r systems
• Implement a threading system 
• Implement a simple file system in the user space
