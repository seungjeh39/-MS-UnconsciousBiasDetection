The materials covered in each exam will NOT be accumulative; the same topics will not be covered in two exams
The highest score of the three exams will be worth 15% of the semester grade
No team submission is allowed; students must submit their projects individually
Each student must submit an independently taken note for one course lecture to gain 0.5
To be counted toward semester grade, the note must be shared through the google drive within one week (7 days) from the lecture given, before 11:59 PM
For example, if a student has submitted a project three days after its deadline, and the student has specified to use exactly one free late day, the student will receive 40% penalty on the score of the project
No late day is allowed for collaborative note taking
All notes must be submitted within 7 days after the lectures (before 11:59 PM)
