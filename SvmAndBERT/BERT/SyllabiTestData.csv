1,,,No prior experience in programming is necessary.
2,,,My major goal is to help mitigate any barriers I can in order for you to excel in this course.
3,,,"The objectives of this course are to inform students about the field of Computer Science and Engineering, and to introduce them to the wide range of exciting applications of computation and technology in society."
4,,,I want you to know that my top priority is for my students to learn as much as they can in my class.
5,,,"The TAs assigned and I are willing to help you to learn and understand the course material, and help you to master your programming skills so please see us during our office hours."
6,,,"At the end of the course, students will understand the basic principles of logic, proofs and sets."
7,,,"In particular, the course assumes some familiarity with low-level programming, some understanding of interrupts from a hardware perspective, and some practice with multithreaded programming and synchronization."
8,,,The course is a broad survey that will require a significant amount of reading with simple introductory programming in different languages. 
9,,,"However, the students are expected to be comfortable with C/C++ as there will be significant amount of programming in this class."
