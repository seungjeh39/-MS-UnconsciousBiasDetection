2,should,,"In addition, students should have had some exposure to basic probability, statistics, data
structures and algorithms.",1
3,,,We do not curve in this class.,1
4,should,,"You should know how to multiply a matrix with a vector, but the most important prerequisite is simply an open mind.",1
5,,,Absence from a lecture is not a valid excuse to be misinformed about any class activity and the student maintains the responsibility for all course content.,1
6,,,"Rather, we teach to mastery which means that we have clear expectations in terms of what you should complete and what knowledge you should have obtained by the end of the course to succeed and to earn an A.",1
7,,,"If you are participating appropriately, trying to adjust based on our feedback, and working equitably with your team, you should expect an A.",1
8,,,"Students should have a basic knowledge of computing and the humanities, and either the ability to program complex systems or able to learn new software tools on their own.",1
9,expected,,Students are expected to have some experience with computer programming and 3D graphics tools prior to taking this course.,1

11,uncertain,,Students who are uncertain of the expected level of technical proficiency are encouraged to contact the instructor to discuss specifics.,1
12,experience,,"Experience with graphical and visualization tools, frameworks, and libraries (e.g., Unity, Unreal, Processing, OpenGL) is recommended. ",1
13,,,"Familiarity with concepts of human-computer interaction, aesthetic design, and mathematical functions is also recommended, but experience with all is not required.",1
14,,,"These objectives will be met through lectures, challenging assignments, regular quizzes, and a final examination.",1
15,,,"We do not curve in this class, however provide you with the opportunity to earn an A, hence an 89.9 is a B.",1
16,,,We teach to mastery which means that we have clear expectations in terms of what you should complete and what knowledge you should have obtained by the end of the course to succeed and to earn an A.,1
17,welcome,,The class style is highly interactive and students are expected to eventually advance to a self-learning process to solve term project problems.,1
