1,,,human-computer interaction - csce 436 (spring 2022) seminar + studio combined class
2,,,"in this class, you will learn various details of cutting-edge technologies and prototyping techniques to make tangible computers for human-computer interaction"
3,,,"this class intends to provide a general understanding of hci theories, design principles, design & implementation techniques, then to offer fundamental skills for prototyping to investigate users’ needs in product/system development"
4,,,"learning outcomes with the focus on a broad spectrum of technical hci, student will be able to describe (1) fundamental hci principles and how they support the process of the new technology development, (2) the process of hci research from need finding to user evaluation, and develop (4) prototypes of digital/physical artifacts using machines and tools– skill acquisitions for effective communication"
