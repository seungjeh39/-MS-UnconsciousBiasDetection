29,,,a baseline r0 version of the course master plan is made available on canvas
30,,,"although some amount of buffer planning has been buil t-in to the schedule, we will respond to situation ‘on the ground’ and respond as dictated by the over -arching goal of maximizing learning and assimilation"
31,,,"prerequisites • csce 312 (computer organization) • familiarity with c/c++ programming (csce 121, csce 221) description the objective of this course is to provide us with a general understanding of what system software is involved for an application program to run, both on a single node and over a network, and how this system software is to be used"
32,,,"in support of this objective , the course will prepare us to do system -level programming"
33,,,"this course will demonstrate how to ""use"" (as opposed to ""design"") system components, such as memory, file systems, process control, inter -process communication, and networking"
34,,,"by the end of this course, we will have an understanding o f the problems and pitfalls typically encountered in the design and implementation of multithreaded and networked applications and systems"
35,,,"more specifically, by the end of this course we should be fairly good at making full use of the services provided by the underlying operating system by programming directly at the operating system interface level"
36,,,"w e will review the following aspects of a computer system, in no particular order: • what is an operating system; what are its components ; why system calls? • execution of a program; function calls; interrupts"
37,,,• the os application interface; file system; process control; etc
38,,,"• inter -process communication • concurr ency, threads, process/thread synchronization • network socket programming • principles and practices for s ecure computing "
39,,,"security threats in centralized and distributed systems; authentication, authorization, confidentiality; security mechanisms"
40,,,"• parallel and distributed computing books (not required for purchase) there is no required textbook for this class : the course material is assembled from multiple sources (books, existing courses, conversation with experts, and published research)"
41,,,"however, the following list of books are most referenced in the assembled material for those who’d like an additiona l source of material to supplement lectures"
42,,,"• primary o [ospp ] operating systems: principles and practice, 2nd edition, thomas anderson and michael dahlin, recursive books, 2014 (here ) o [ostep ] operating systems: three easy pieces"
43,,,"[available online free here ] • secondary o [apue ] advanced programming in the unix environment, 3rd edition, w"

51,,,2021 lectures lectures will be remote -asynchronous meaning the lecture content will be released on canvas weekly according to the master schedule
52,,,"barring exception, effort will be made to release weekly content on the weekend in case you have discretionary time to read ahead"
53,,,during lectures we will be covering operating systems and systems programming concepts and case studies
54,,,the material covered in the lectures will provide the background and foundation for you to appreciate the lab exercises designed to buttress lecture concepts an d to prepare to succeed in programming assignments 
55,,,"quizzes quizzes will be ‘take -home’ format offered on canvas , and aligned with key topic learnings"
56,,,"in most cases, quizzes will be online short format, multiple choice type of questions to test basic understanding of concepts presented during the lectures"
57,,,"labs labs will be held in-person, face -2-face"
58,,,"given the university requirements for the prescribed format of this course, the labs will not be conducted over zoom so if you are unable to be in college station physically, you may need to defer this course to a later semester"
59,,,"labs are where we will pu t into practice the material learned in the lectures, and where we will acquire a working knowledge of the unix /linux operating system "
60,,,labs will meet twice weekly (tr for sections 500 -507 and two back -2-back sessions on friday for sections 597-599) where we will be presenting a new problem to motivate learning and facilitat e skill-building 
61,,,"after an introductory session to familiarize you with the particular environment that we will be using, there will be a continuing series of lab exercise s and programming assignments of moderate difficulty level , which will exercise different parts of the operating system: process and thread management, inter -process communication, networked execution, and so on"
62,,,there will be 6 programming assignments (pa 0-5) assigned roughly on a bi -weekly basis
63,,,"we will kick -off the course with pa0 which is a simple, warm -up exercise in c++"
64,,,the master -plan contains the details
65,,,"lab attendance is critical to ensure you understand the problem, actively hash the problem out with your classmates , and clarify with lab ta ’s and pt’s "
66,,,assessment method (subject to minor changes!) : the course will have two exams and a series of quizzes and programming assignments 
67,,,the grade allocation is as follows: 1
68,,,"exams (midte rm and final ) = 40% (midterm=22%, final = 18%) 2"
69,,,programming assignments = 54% (each project is 9% of the grade) 3
70,,,online -take -home quizzes ( 20+) = 6% the grading scale is as follows: • 90-100: a • 80-89: b • 70 – 79: c • 60 – 69: d • 59 and below: f late submission policy – subject to change exam and quiz late policies are stringent and fairly straightforward • exams : no exception without prior e-mail approval from the instructor 
71,,,see university policy for details
72,,,• quizzes : online on canvas
73,,,late submissions will not be accepted without prior e - mail approval from the instructor
74,,,"for the programming assignments, we are attempting something new for the late submission policy"
75,,,"below , a general philosophy is presented"
76,,,"philosophy : we all have varying working habits - some start early, some wait till the last minute"
77,,,"we are also affected by our environment - last minute surprises can come, health, etc"
78,,,"in addition, this course is typically paired with csce -315 which is also project intensive"
79,,,"so, we are planning to adopt a policy that accommodates the unknowns to some extent and also gives you the flexibility to respond to peaks and troughs in your enrolled course schedules : early turnin wins credit, late turnins earn penalty but can use earned c redits to offset the penalty "
80,,,"in the end, the overall accrued credit/ penalty is applied on the sum total which is then scaled"
81,,,a separate document describing the policy in detail with examples will be made available on canvas
82,,,exams there will be one midt erm and one final examination
83,,,both exams will be offered online on canva s with required in -person attendance during designated lab session
84,,,those with accommodations from the department of disability resources (link ) must arrange to take the exam at the center
85,,,any exceptions to the above must be obtained from the instructor well in advance with proper justification via e -mail
86,,,the course master calendar will contain the exam dates and they will also be communicated in teams and canvas well in advance
87,,,"communication policy your teaching staff will do their best to communicate relevant administrative information (deadlines, information about posted material, details about projects, locations of tutorials, and so on) in an effective and timely manner"
88,,,we will be using microsoft teams platform for all course communication
89,,,please refer to the document “ csce313 how do i setup microsoft teams ” available on canvas in student r esources module 
90,,,it contains simple steps to install teams and sign on to our course teams site
91,,,"at times, reinforcement messages may also be sent via canvas, but our discussion forum is ms teams"
92,,,e-mails listed on course roster are used for enrollment in canvas and teams 
93,,,"if you are not receiving teams or canvas updates, please contact the instructor"
94,,,"teaching staff support it is important to lay out broad expectations for support as follows based on the roles: your instructor will be on hand to answer queries on lectures and practice questions, offer mentoring, and conduct quiz/exam review sessions/support"
95,,,"your ta’s will conduct labs (graduate ta’s) , answer queries on pa’s, lab exercises, and lab quizzes, provide code qualit y feedback for pa submissions"
96,,,their time is best spent on providing clarifications on assignments and offer detailed feedback on coding quality and organization
97,,,"your graders will not directly interface with you in labs but will work behind the scene in grading programming assignments, and quizzes/exams per discretion of your instructor"
98,,,"as a general policy, i am asking the ta’s to not assist with debugging student code"
99,,,it is both counter -productive to student learning and extremely stressful for the t eaching staff
100,,,they will expend much of the feedback in providing a clear understanding of the programming assignment expectations and common best practices

115,,,the instructor is especially grateful to drs
116,,,"bettati and ahmed for making their entire course content available for use in this semester offering, especially because the instructor is returning to teach this course after a nearly 4+year hiatus"
117,,,programming assignment content : pa’s have gone through evolution in the last several years
118,,,original programming assignments were created under the auspices of professors riccardo bettati and guofei gu
119,,,the instructor (tyagi) taught this course between 2014 -2016
120,,,"during spring 2016, a small number of enterprising undergraduate students took the daunting task of working with the instructor and (then ta) prof"
121,,,sarker tanzir ahmed to create a new set of programming assignments in addition to revising the existing ones
122,,,the resulti ng set of programming assignments was piloted by prof
123,,,"ahmed in his fall 2016 csce -313 course and resulting student feedback was rolled in to the spring 2017 offering, and improved ever since"
124,,,"the lion’s share of contributions was made by andrew kirfman an d joshua higginbotham, both former csce undergraduate students"
125,,,both the instructor and prof
126,,,ahmed are grateful for their contributions and honor their lasting legacy toward the benefit of the cse student community
127,,,"and finally, a note for the sake of ou r health and well -being: to help protect aggieland and stop the spread of covid -19, texas a&m university urges students to be vaccinated and to wear masks in classrooms and all other academic facilities on campus, including labs"
128,,,"doing so exemplifies the aggie core values of respect, leadership, integrity, and selfless service by putting community concerns above individual preferences"
129,,,"covid -19 vaccines and masking — regardless of vaccination status — have been shown to be safe and effective at reducing spread to others, infection, hospitalization, and death"
