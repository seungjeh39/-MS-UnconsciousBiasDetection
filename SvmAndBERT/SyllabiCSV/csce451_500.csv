3,,,"office hour by appointment, on -line course description this course aims to introduce the art of inferring, and/or reproducing of partial or complete high -level computing logics from a binary executable code with out the original source codes"
4,,,the cou rse starts with introduction of the relationship among high level programming languages and x86 asm statements 
5,,,"it will then expand to the x86 instruction set architecture (isa) and its computing models, and the compiler generated binary executables "
6,,,"through extensive hands -on exercises, assignments and tests, students will be guided to learn to develop the reserving strategy, starting from scope of reversing goal, hypothesis formation , iterative validation , selection of tool chains for static and dynamic analysis , disassembling, up to validation of reversing outcomes"
7,,,"the class also introduces basics of exploits , and defensive design against static and dynamic analysis"
8,,,students are required to learn about the basics of legality and ethics of software reversing
9,,,the term hacking refers to the process of exploiting vulnerability of software systems by manual or automated processes
10,,,"learning about hacking practices is essential to build defensive software systems, but misuse of the skills in the real -world environment can have serious legal consequences"
11,,,"re related laws differ greatly in different countr ies, region s, and types of activities"
12,,,students are advised to take great cautions in their conducts
13,,,"a “gut feeling, common sense” based mentality can lead to regrettable situations"
14,,,in this class students will learn about selective legal cases related to real world re cases 
15,,,"course prerequisites ● minimal requirement: csce 313, or instructor’s approval"
16,,,"students must be proficient in common hll languages, programming, and common microprocessor architecture(s)"
17,,,"● jr/sr classification, but exception can be made per instructor’s ap proval"
18,,,course syllabus page 2 of 8 ● this class has extensive hands -on work
19,,,students are advised to weigh their overall workload in taking this course
20,,,"special course designation n/a course learning outcomes at end of the class, students should be proficient in the following aspects"
21,,, identify common copyrights and other related laws governing software rights and their reverse engineering activities
22,,, gain knowledge on the relationship between hll and assembly statements
23,,, identify and utilize the knowledge on the compilation process to identify high level language programs and their machine code interpretations
24,,, extract the needed binary code structure information from the portable executable file formats
25,,," form ulation and optimization of reversing strategies (such as brute force based, or math logic based) to perform static & dynamic analysis of binary codes"
26,,, survey of re resources  validation of disassembler outcomes
27,,, gain knowledge on anti -analysis techniques to protect binaries
28,,,"textbook and/or resource materials ● none required ● reference books (not exclusive) ● assembly language for intel based computers, by irvine ● the ida pro book, by chris eagle ● reverse engineering, secret of reverse engineering, by eldad eilam ● practical malware analysis, by m"

30,,,"honig ● open literature, vendors technical information (intel, microsoft) ● a laptop computer with sufficient performance to run a designated linux virtual machine, compilers and re tools"
31,,,the laptop should also have large hdd space and main memory
32,,,"past experience suggests that common laptops would be usable for class activities, but lack of computing resources can significantly affect the productivity or even classwork outcomes"
33,,,"● major tools ida pro, ghidra, godbolt.org"
34,,,"linux and compilers , various utility tools grading policy • labs, exercises, assignments 40% • tests 40% course syllabus page 3 of 8 • final project 20% • the grading scale : by numerical ranking of total scores"
35,,,special rules for graded team projects ● every student is required to contribute technical and documentation work
36,,,"● if there is a project partner dispute, it is critical to report the issue quickly to the instructor or ta"
37,,,"otherwise, you share grade consequences if the issues contribute to a poor grade"
38,,,"in most cases, you are encouraged to discuss assignments, but the final product submitted for grade must be the individual work of the person turning it in "
39,,,"using third party codes and tools to solve challenging computing problems is critical to most software reverse engineering, and therefore is allowed"
40,,,"when doing so, it is a must to have full disclosure prior reporting results"
41,,,claiming credit without s uch disclosure will be considered cheating
42,,,"graded attendance – ● all absences from graded activities – tests, quizzes and some timed lab exercises require prior approval of the instructor"
43,,,students without prior absence approval may be allow ed to make up the missing activity with 2 5% or more grade penalty
44,,,● students are responsible for any missed materials
45,,,● university excused absence are defined by student rule 7; see http://student - rules.tamu.edu/rule07
46,,,● 3-strike rule: a final grade of d/f for m issing 3 graded activities
47,,,● if advance notification is not possible (e.g
48,,,"unexpected illness , family emergency ) for the absence, contact the instructor at the earliest time with some supporting evidence/document"
49,,,late work policy • late work will be accepted up to one day late with a 25% penalty
