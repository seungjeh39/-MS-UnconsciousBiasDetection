14,,,detailed course description csce 482 is a project-oriented course aimed at developing system integration skills
15,,,students work in groups of 3-5 people to complete a significant engineering design project
16,,,"every project requires complete implementation, documentation and demonstration of a computing system design with both hardware and software components"
17,,,"the focus is not only on the final product but also on design methodology, management process and teamwork"
18,,,each team will be required to manage its own efforts to complete its project in a timely manner
19,,,group members will be required to keep individual lab notebooks recording their efforts and their personal impressions of the project
20,,,students will be graded based on both the quality of the group product and their individual contributions
21,,,"every team will be required to schedule a weekly meeting with the course instructor and the ta, preferably during the official class or lab hours"
22,,,these meetings must be attended by every group member
23,,,"since the projects will be student managed, the exact nature and style of these meetings is at the group’s discretion"
24,,,"however, every member of the group is expected to participate "
25,,,"at the end of the semester, each group will make a public presentation describing and demonstrating their work"
26,,,these presentations will be open to the university community
27,,,course objectives to prepare students for engineering practice with a major design experience based on the knowledge and skills acquired in earlier course work and incorporating engineering standards and realistic constraints that include most of the following considerations: economic; environmental; sustainability; manufacturability; ethical; health and safety; social; and political
28,,,expected outcomes it is expected that successful participation in the course will allow the student to demonstrate: ● analyze a complex computing problem and to apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions
29,,,"● design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program’ s discipline"
30,,,● communicate ef fectively in a variety of professional contexts
31,,,● recognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgments in computing practice based on legal and ethical principles
32,,,● function ef fectively as a member or leader of a team engaged in activities appropriate to the program’ s discipline
33,,,● apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing-based solutions
34,,,grading policy the final grade you will receive in the class will be based on points accumulated during the semester
35,,,"thus, both continued progress (the process) and the quality of your product (and other deliverables) will determine your grade"
36,,,"although the bulk of your grade is based on the performance of your team, individual performance will also be gauged"
37,,,1
38,,,"project proposal (5%) : these points will be based on (1) the originality, creativity and feasibility of the proposed work, the analysis of alternative solutions, the consideration of economic and societal aspects, the project management approach (3%), and (2) the quality of the oral presentation (2%)"
39,,,a template for the proposal report and a presentation rubric are available on the course webpage
40,,,2
41,,,critical design review (10%) : the cdr is a mid-semester evaluation of your project
42,,,"the grade will be based on your progress to date, and the quality of the oral presentation and accompanying written report"
43,,,a template for the cdr report and a presentation rubric are available on the course webpage 
44,,,3
45,,,"final communication (15%): this grade will be based on the quality of the final presentation (5%), as well as the contents and professional finish of the documentation (10%)"
46,,,a template for the final report and a presentation rubric are available on the course webpage
47,,,4
48,,,weekly progress (10%): this grade will be based on your team’s ability to maintain the project on schedule
49,,,"the weekly report should be incremental , and should specifically address the following: a"
50,,,agenda for the weekly meeting with the instructor and the ta b
51,,,"any major accomplishments during this time period , including figures and results c"
52,,,an overview of the plan of work for the following two weeks d
53,,,"an update on project management, including teamwork, purchases, schedule and milestone status e"
54,,,minutes of the previous meeting weekly progress reports are due two hours prior to the time of the weekly meeting
55,,,the responsibility of preparing these reports will be rotated among team members
56,,,"the team member preparing the report will also be in charge of facilitating the discussions during that weekly meeting, and preparing an action list for the following week"
57,,,the action list contains the set of specific goals that each team member has agreed to complete and a deadline for completing them
58,,,5
59,,,"project grade (20%): a final grade will be assigned to your project based on the completion of all the objectives stated in the proposal, as well as on a live demonstration in front of the class"
60,,,the complexity of your project and the size of your team will be factored in
61,,,due date: project demonstrations will take place 48 hours prior to the final presentation (or the friday prior if on a weekend)
62,,,this earlier deadline for the demo ensures that teams have time to prepare the final communication and final presentation
63,,,for items 1-5: using github sites for your group and grading purposes: i
64,,,teams will use the tamu enterprise github (https://github.tamu.edu/
65,,,to organize and trace course progress and materials
66,,,"all required group materials such as project proposal, weekly report, cdr, final report and presentation files, should be shared on the tamu github"
67,,,the activity log there will be used to assess how each individual contributed to the team as well
68,,,ii
69,,,"teams should make use of github features such as the readme, issues, wiki, etc, in order to provide documentation for their project"
70,,,6
71,,,teamwork (10%): it is very important to understand that accomplishing the technical objectives of the project is not sufficient
72,,,these accomplishments should not come at the expense of destroying relationships among team members
73,,,"thus, a grade will be assigned based on the ability of the group to function as a team"
74,,,is there evidence that the group engaged in team building activities? were contributions to the project evenly distributed? were members equally engaged in discussions during meetings? was there an effective division of responsibilities? among the 10%: i
75,,,2% is given to the teamwork quiz and ii
76,,,8% is determined by final evaluation of teamwork effectiveness
77,,,the project grade is a direct outcome of teamwork
78,,,teamwork grade level cannot be higher than project grade
79,,,individua l performance (30%): points in this category are awarded based on assessments of your personal contribution to the team efforts: a
80,,,notebook (5%): you are required to record what you do as a member of the project
81,,,entries in the notebook should be made during or shortly after every work session
82,,,"each entry should include (1) the date, (2) the objectives for that session, and (3) record of what was done"
83,,,a grade will be assigned to your personal design notebook based on: i
84,,,the regularity of your entries throughout the semester
85,,,ii
86,,,"the evidence of an engineering design process, including but not limited to schematics, block diagrams, circuits, pseudo-code, tables of experimental results, and mathematical derivations"
87,,,iii
88,,,"the clarity, legibility and organization of your annotations"
89,,,you can choose either paper-based notebook or electronic-based notebook: paper-based notebooks must have permanent binding (i.e.
90,,,"composition pads); spiral-bound notebooks will not be accepted, failing to do so will result in a 5% penalty on the final grade"
91,,,electronic notebook can be either word file or pdf file
92,,,the file should clearly contain aforementioned materials in an organized manner
93,,,the file should be cumulative which contains all the information since the beginning of the class
94,,,b
95,,,"participation (4%): the instructor and ta will evaluate your attendance to meetings, participation in the discussions, and contributions to the team"
96,,,"team leaders will instead be evaluated by their ability to make the group operate as a team, i.e."
97,,,item (6) above
98,,,c
99,,,peer review (9%): your performance will be evaluated by each of your team members throughout the semester
100,,,there are three peer reviews throughout the semester
101,,,d
102,,,github insights (10%): all projects will be hosted on tamu’s enterprise github (github.tamu.edu)
103,,,"all project code should be managed, from the project beginning, in this system"
104,,,"through proper version control techniques, your individual work history on the project will be documented"
105,,,you will be required to maintain a stable main project branch by implementing features on separate working branches and creating pull requests for the entire team to review and merge into the main branch
106,,,you will be assigned a grade for your github contributions based on: i
107,,,(3%) the regularity of your commit history throughout the semester
108,,,"for example, if you only commit code at the last week of semester, you will lose the three points"
109,,,ii
110,,,(4%) the quality and quantity of code and documentation you committed to the project throughout the semester
111,,,"note: code quality including metrics such as structure, readability, and efficiency will be weighted more heavily than the number of lines of code committed"
112,,,iii
113,,,"(4%) adherence to good version control practices such as using branches to develop new features without affecting the main branch, avoiding bundling unrelated changes into single commits, and writing good commit messages"
114,,,e
115,,,online course about ethics (2%) : we will provide an online ethics course in canvas
116,,,"note : grades will not be assigned until all project deliverables have been turned in (see below), all borrowed items (e.g."
117,,,"keys, books, equipment) have been returned to their proper location or their owner, and the workstations in the lab have been thoroughly cleaned up"
118,,,all team members are required to be present at the time of the final delivery unless due to excused absence allowed by student rule 7
