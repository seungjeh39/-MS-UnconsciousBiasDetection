2,,,"1/15s y l l ab u s senior capstone design effective design requires identifying the “right” problem to solve, building components that meet that problem’ s needs, and integrating components into a single solution system"
3,,,"as problems become more challenging, solid design, follow through, and teamwork skills become necessary to developing a solution"
4,,,every computer scientist and computer engineer who wants to work on big problems must have these skills
5,,,"after this course, you will be able to: analyze a complex computing problem and identify solutions using computing principles, design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of requirements, apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing- based solutions, collaborate effectively as a member of a team, recognize professional responsibilities, both legal and ethical, and make informed judgements in computing practice, and communicate you will work in groups of 4-5 people to complete a significant engineering design project"
6,,,"every project requires complete implementation, documentation, evaluation, and demonstration of a computing system design"
7,,,"the focus is not only on the final product but also on design methodology , management process, and teamwork"
8,,,"at the end of the semester , each group will make a public presentation describing and demonstrating their work"
9,,,why i teach this course this course of fers you a unique learning experience
10,,,"the t a and i are always especially excited to teach this course, and here is why: you finally get to combine everything that you have learned throughout your entire undergraduate curriculum"
11,,,"this not only includes the computer science skills you have gained, but also the professional, cultural, and communication skills that you have developed"
12,,,this is an opportunity for you to try to solve a problem that matters to you
13,,,this course gives you a lot of freedom and choice in your semester-long project

21,,,"every semester is different, every team is different, every solution is different"
22,,,there is always something new to learn and innovate
23,,,smaller class sizes and weekly meetings allow you to connect with your classmates and your instructor 
24,,,"about working in teams because your teammates' grades are so tightly coupled with your own dedication to the class, many of the assignments and rules are put in place to protect you and your teammates"
25,,,"these include requirements to participate actively in class, complete assignments in a timely manner , and treat your classmates with respect"
26,,,each team is required to: time management: manage its own ef forts to complete its project in a timely manner 
27,,,you are graded based on both the quality of the group product and their individual contributions
28,,,weekly status update meetings: hold a weekly meeting with the course instructor and the t as during the of ficial class hours
29,,,these meetings must be attended by every group member 
30,,,"since the projects will be student managed, the exact nature and style of these meetings is at the group’ s discretion, e.g."
