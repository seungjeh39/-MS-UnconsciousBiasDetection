8,,,1 course information 1.
9,,,course description csce 312 is an introductory course on computer organization
10,,,it provides insights into the fundamentals of organization and structure of computer systems
11,,,"one of the objectives of this course is to teach critical thinking, how to learn, and how to communicate technical concepts in the area of computer systems"
12,,,"these objectives will be met through lectures, challenging assignments, regular quizzes, and a final examination"
13,,,"the course consists of materials on the following topics: introduction to computer systems, data representation, machine language, processor architecture, memory hierarchy, linking, exception control flow, virtual memory, system level i/o, and network programming"
14,,,several laboratory assignments will provide hands-on experience on some of the above topics
15,,,projects allow students to implement material taught in the lectures and laboratory
16,,,1.
17,,,"catalog description introduction to computer systems from programmer’s perspective: simple logic design, data representation and processor architecture, programming of processors, memory, control flow, input/output, and performance measurements; hands-on lab assignments"
18,,,1.
19,,,co-requisites csce 221 data structures and algorithms
20,,,"you should have a clear understanding of data structures, including list, stacks, and queues"
21,,,your familiarity with recursion and exposure to complexity analysis are desirable
22,,,lab assignments will require basic computer skills in implementing the above topics
23,,,1.

28,,,"(ansi c version) or later, kernighan & ritchie, prentice hall, will be helpful in learning the operating system and programming environment"
29,,,"2 course topics, quizzes and assignments students are required to read the main textbook and other assigned materials as announced time to time"
30,,,it is highly recommended to be familiar with the material ahead of the corresponding lecture
31,,,"this course will focus on the topics shown below, which may not be covered in this order, or at all, if time does not permit it"
32,,,the length of time to cover a topic and the corresponding assignment dates may vary

39,,,attendance policy class attendance is strongly recommended
40,,,students are responsible for any material missed
41,,,some material covered in the lectures may not be found in the textbook or the slides
42,,,"missed exams, quizzes and class presentations may be made up only for a university-excused absence"
43,,,other special situations must be discussed with the instructor in advance of the exam
44,,,3.
45,,,"grading the course consists of lectures, quizzes, homeworks, lab assignments, projects and final examination"
46,,,the grade will be computed as follows: course grading projects 15% pop quiz/homework 15% laboratory assignments 20% quizzes 25% final exam 25% extra credit assignments and extra credit for significant class participation may be offered
47,,,"letter grades will be assigned as follows: 90-100% a, 80-89% b, 70-79% c, 60-69% d, < 60% f"
48,,,3.
49,,,examinations the quizzes will be held in class with exact dates determined during the semester
50,,,note that there is no mid-term exam
51,,,the quizzes are scheduled after each topic is completed
52,,,"the quizzes and final exam will generally test your knowledge of assignment material, so you are responsible for mastering all lab, homework, and project material submitted with other partners, as if you did all the work by yourself"
53,,,the quizzes and final exam will be closed book and closed notes (unless otherwise stated)
54,,,the nature of the course material is such that the final exam must be cumulative
55,,,3.
56,,,"assignments homework, lab exercises and project are substantial assignments"
57,,,"homework assignments: homework will be assigned sporadically, typically consisting of end-of-chapter exercises"
58,,,"homework assignments can be carried out by one person, unless stated otherwise"
59,,,"assignments are expected to be completed in one to two weeks, as specified by the due date"
60,,,"laboratory exercises: labs are intended to prepare you to tackle the projects, and you will typically be able to complete labs during the assigned lab period"
61,,,written lab work will be accepted up to the beginning of the following lab period
62,,,"to obtain credit for a lab you typically must obtain a “check-off” from your teaching assistant, signifying that you completed the work during the scheduled lab time"
63,,,you are responsible for attending lab and demonstrating to your lab instructor that you have completed the work
64,,,"course projects: one or more course projects will integrate most concepts covered during the semester, but are more open-ended than regular assignments"
65,,,a written proposal and a final report will be required
66,,,the final report and program source code will be due by the announced deadline
67,,,the projects will be carried out by a group of two to four people
68,,,you are encouraged to form groups as early as possible
69,,,course labs and projects will involve programming and solving problems in computer organization in c or c++ and the systemc language
70,,,all tools are run on departmental unix/linux and windows pc systems
71,,,assignments will be placed on the course web page
72,,,the correct approach is to start working on assignments as early as possible and contact us when you encounter difficulties
73,,,"in general, the closer to the deadline you request our assistance the harder it might be to obtain our help"
74,,,3.
75,,,deadline policy turn in all work by the established deadline
76,,,in case you have difficulties finishing an assignment contact the ta or the instructor before the deadline
77,,,"late work can be accepted only under circumstances beyond student's control and after arrangement with the ta or instructor, prior to the deadline"
78,,,note: work turned-in on time is eligible for partial credit
79,,,"it will always be better to turn work in by the deadline, as trying to ""perfect"" it and turning it in late will give you no points at all"
80,,,3.
81,,,"submission of work and late submission policy all assignments/deliverables must be submitted electronically, by the due date and time, using the turn-in procedure on csnet"
82,,,"late submission beyond the cutoff will not be accepted in general, unless a university sanctioned excuse is provided ahead of time"
83,,,"a student will earn points when he/she submits the assignment on time, by the partial credit policy"
84,,,note that emailsubmissions will not be accepted (they will be ignored without notice)
85,,,you have to follow the submission and media policies and guidelines published on the course web site
86,,,"in general, late submission will be penalized with a loss of 25% of the total points earned per day late"
87,,,partial credit will be given based on the work submitted
88,,,3.
89,,,"re-grading policy a student can request re-grading of assignments and exams, if he/she believes that the points assigned are inconsistent with the quality and merits of the submitted work"
90,,,to request re-grading you have to follow the guidelines below
91,,,1
92,,,re-grading requests must be submitted at most one week after the item has been graded and returned to the student and solutions have been made public
93,,,"after this time, no re-grading requests will be honored"
94,,,2
95,,,re-grading requests must be as specific as possible and must be accompanied by a reasonable amount of justification and documentation
96,,,requests must be in written form for major assignments and exams
97,,,3
98,,,e-mails must be sent to tas and the instructor within the one week time limit
99,,,3.
100,,,excused absences and make-up policy make-ups for assignments and exams will be given only for university-excused absences
101,,,"prior arrangements with the instructor must be made when feasible and official verification of circumstances necessitating the absence will be required, as permitted by the texas a&m university student rules (http://student-rules.tamu.edu)"
