2,,,"1/11s y l l ab u s programming studio it is estimated that windows xp has 50,000,000 lines of code"
3,,,the average mobile phone has over 10 million lines of code
4,,,"the average developer writes 10 – 20 useful lines of code per day , so a couple of engineers and 2 friends could break away , start a new company , and create a new “windows” operating system in only about 1700 years "
5,,,that’ s not reasonable
6,,,"up until now , most of the programs that you have been asked to write could probably fit in your mind"
7,,,"when you complete the letter , you fold it, seal it up, and mail it of f (or hit send)"
8,,,"but now it is plain to see that products that you use daily simply could not be recreated by you and 10 of your best friends in an afternoon, weekend, or semester "
9,,,a 1700-year project is wildly unreasonable
10,,,there must be a better way 
11,,,"in this course, you will learn a better way "
12,,,"you will dive into the world of software engineering and hone your teamwork (and, yes, coding) skills"
13,,,"ef fective teamwork is essential, and software design methodologies make development more ef ficient"
14,,,"this course gives you very practical skills for being an ef fective member of a development team and producing high-quality , sustainable software"
15,,,"learning these methods of working together , managing requirements, producing quality software products, and testing, delivering, and maintaining these products is every bit as valuable as coding"
16,,,why i teach this course this course is of fers you a unique learning experience
17,,,"i am always especially excited to teach this course, and here is why: building software is fun and rewarding you get many opportunities to “learn by doing” there’ s more to software than just coding you get a taste of software engineering working on teams can be messy , but it’ s worth it it is amazing what you can accomplish together , so much more than on your own course information course number: 315 course t itle: programming studio 1/17/22, 4:30 pm syllabus: 22 spring csce 315 908-91 1,970: programming studio https://canvas.tamu.edu/courses/136192/pages/syllabu"

58,,,"5/11team projects – 40%: two major projects, each worth 20% of the course grade, for 40% total"
59,,,specific grading practices for each project will be announced when that project is given out
60,,,"y our individual contribution determined from logged code commits, peer evaluation, and instructor/t a observations will be a significant contributing factor to these project grades"
61,,,individual project – 5%: the individual project will be completed prior to the team projects
62,,,specific grading practices will be announced when the assignment is given out
63,,,written elements – 35%: this is a writing intensive course
64,,,y ou are required to pass this component with a c or better to earn a grade in the course
65,,,"y ou will have several written assignments within the projects (roughly 10% from the individual project, 12% from the first team project, and 13% from the second team project)"
66,,,specific grading practices will be announced when each assignment is given out
67,,,other course activities – 20%: the course has several dif ferent types of activities to help you better understand concepts and connect with the material
68,,,"this includes (but is not limited to) at- home activities, in-class activities, and lab activities"
69,,,"these activities bring deeper , longer-term learning as you work, either individually or with other students"
70,,,"for submitted assignments, grading will be based on the quality of the submitted work"
71,,,"for group assignments, your full participation is required to receive a grade for that assignment "
72,,,"this component will be divided as follows: 10% in-class activities (lowest grade dropped), 5% lab activities (lowest grade dropped), 3% at-home activities, and 2% in-class knowledge checks (lowest two grades dropped)"
73,,,grading scale: grades will be assigned according to the following scale: a >= 90 > b >= 80 > c >= 70 > d >= 60 > f these grades represent varying degrees of achievement (see the university's grading system (https://registrar.tamu.edu/transcripts-grades/grades#0-gradingsystem
