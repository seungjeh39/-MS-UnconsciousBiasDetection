5,,,projects and assignments are designed such that each student can show of f their own skills
6,,,programming and software development is part of the group projects so it is recommended that students from outside of computer science join project teams with students from computer science
7,,,list of students in class course description this class investigates three topics related to computational media: (1) how do interactive media change the authoring and consumption of stories/narratives? (2) what are the techniques and interfaces used to interact with content in a variety of media? (3) how does networked access and authoring of media content change our views of ownership and intellectual property? these topics will be discussed at both a conceptual and tool level
8,,,"by the end of the course, you will be able to look at an existing system or design a new system with an understanding of the impact it may have on communication and storytelling"
9,,,"prerequisites students should have a basic knowledge of computing and the humanities, and either the ability to program complex systems or able to learn new software tools on their own"
10,,,ask instructor if you have any questions
11,,,reading materials reading schedule this course will focus around discussions of the readings
12,,,"we will read two books and assorted papers taken from a variety of conferences and journals concerning human-computer interaction, hypertext, media studies, and computers and the humanities"

18,,,short assignments list of assignments
19,,,there will be a number of assignments due in class
20,,,"these assignments may require use of specific software outside of class time and will take the form of short essays, written answers to questions, and design documents"
21,,,all material turned in should be printed using a computer printer or typed except when noted otherwise
22,,,homework late policy: 10% is deducted from your grade for every school day late up to a maximum of one week after the original due date
23,,,class participation most class periods will include a discussion of reading materials
24,,,all students are expected to have done the readings and be able to participate in discussions
25,,,project students will form three- to five-person teams and define a semester project or select one from a list of existing ideas
26,,,"there will be three preliminary progress reports for the projects emphasizing particular phases of the interface design process: (1) identifying a topic, determining cognitive and social issues, and determining an approach, (template for slides ) (2) creating an initial system design and mock-up, ( template for slides ) and (3) instantiating the design in a prototype implementation (template for slides )"
27,,,the final project report (8-12 pages in the old acm conference format ) will also require the design of an evaluation procedure for refining the resulting interface
28,,,the in-class presentations of project progress will be about 4 minutes long and the final presentation on the project will be approximately 15 minutes long and include all members of the team
29,,,project grades will be determined by both the instructor's review of the project and student's description of their and other member's work
30,,,programming for projects: done in language and operating system of your choice on machines to which you have access
