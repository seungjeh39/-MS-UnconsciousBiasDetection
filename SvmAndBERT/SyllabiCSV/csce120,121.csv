36,,,"diversity equity and inclusion accessibility statements michael moore's accessibility statement while the new disability accommodation portal (aim portal) will ease sharing accommodation information, you must still make an appointment with me to discuss your accommodations"
37,,,"in addition to accommodations, i can help you develop strategies to become successful in this course"
38,,,"prior to being a professor, i worked as a certified sign language interpreter in the state of texas while getting my ms and phd degrees in computer science"
39,,,i have a great interest in providing an environment where students with disabilities can thrive
40,,,i wish i could accommodate anyone for any need
41,,,"however, the university requires that i only provide accommodations for students registered with disability resources "
42,,,i’m always fascinated with the rich tapestry of diversity which make up my classes
43,,,"in fact, i teach a course on accessible computing which focuses on principles for creating accessible applications and programs"
44,,,"“i’d prefer that you get your accommodations and not need them, rather than trying without your accommodations and finding out that you neede d them."
45,,,earlier in my career i noticed a disturbing pattern
46,,,student s would try to get through the first exam without using their accommodations
47,,,i suspect this was due to negative experiences with prior instructors
48,,,"frequently, they said they just wanted to try it without the accommodation"
49,,,"after the first exam, there would be a rush of students submitting their accommodation letters"
50,,,these instances have greatly decreased since i’ve been explicit about my preferences
51,,,"philip ritchey's accessibility statement i recognize disability as an aspect of diversity, equity, and inclusion"
52,,,"for that reason, i try to design all of my course material to be inclusive and accessible"
53,,,"however, i realize that some aspects of the course may not yet be as inclusive as they could be"
54,,,i rely in part on my students to let me know when and where they need some accommodation
55,,,i want you to know that my top priority is for my students to learn as much as they can in my class
56,,,that includes working with students to find solutions that help them perform at their best
57,,,i hope tools like the disability accommodation portal will make it easier for students to start the conversation about how we can work together to help them make the most out of their learning opportunities
58,,,paul taele's accessibility statement your experience in this class is important to me
59,,,it is the policy and practice of texas a&m university to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law
60,,,"if you have already established accommodations with disability resources, please activate your accommodations via aim portal ( click here to access the aim portallinks to an external site"
61,,,) so we can discuss how they will be implemented in this course
62,,,"if you have not yet established services through disability resources, but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations (conditions include but not limited to; mental health, attention- related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health impacts), contact disability resources directly to set up an accessibility plan"
63,,,disability 4 of 13 resources facilitates the interactive process that establishes reasonable accommodations
64,,,click here for disability resources's website.link
65,,,to an external site
66,,,"brennen taylor's accessibility statement inclusivity is important to me, and i commit to making all course materials as accessible as i can"
67,,,part of this includes support for students with disabilities
68,,,"in addition to being required by campus policy, i have personally worked with students whose utilization of the resources available to them has helped them achieve greater success in their completion of the course"
69,,,please activate your accommodations in the new disability accommodation portal (aim portal) 
70,,,"in addition, at the very least, shoot me an email and make we aware of your accommodations so i can be aware and work with you"
71,,,i would also be happy to meet with any student and discuss their accommodations if you prefer that as well
72,,,"preferred name and preferred gender pronouns professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender, gender variance, and nationalities"
73,,,class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name
74,,,i will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun
75,,,please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that i may make appropriate changes to my records
76,,,"non- discrimination policy texas a&m is committed to the fundamental principles of academic freedom, equality of opportunity and human dignity"
77,,,"to fulfill its multiple missions as an institution of higher learning, texas a&m encourages a climate that values and nurtures collegiality, diversity, pluralism and the uniqueness of the individual within our state, nation and world"
78,,,all decisions and actions involving students and employees should be based on applicable law and individual merit
79,,,"texas a&m university prohibits students, employees, and third parties from engaging in discrimination and/or harassment on the basis of race, color, sex, gender identity, age, religion, disability, national origin, sexual orientation, genetic infor mation, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state, or local law"
80,,,"in addition, act ing in complicity with another who engages in any of these forms of prohibited conduct, or retaliating against a person who participates in protected activity, is also prohibited"

82,,,a pattern of behavior directed agai nst a particular student with the intent of humiliating or intimidating that student will not be tolerated
83,,,"the mere expression of one’s ideas is not harassment and is fully protected by academic freedom, but personal harassment of individual students is not permitted"
