2,,,"office hours: wf 10:30 am – 11:30 am , all office hours will be held on zoom course description and prerequisites this course gives a self -contained introduction to quantum algorithms, one of the most exciting recent developments in computer science"
3,,,we do not expect any background knowledge in quantum computing nor in quantum physics
4,,,"you should know how to multiply a matrix with a vector, but the most important prerequisite is simply an open mind"
5,,,"course learning outcomes at the end of this course, students should understand the basics of the quantum circuit model, be able to understand fundamental quantum algorithm s, and ways to protect quantum information"

14,,,(check daily for updates) page 2 of 5 grading policy your grade will be based on the following components: - midterm exam 30%: the exams will be given in class 
15,,,"- final project 40%: you will have to write a term paper and record your presentation - homework and exercises 30%: th is is a mix of online questions and essay style assignments, for which you are required to use the latex typesetting system to type in your answers"
16,,,all assignments can be found in canvas 
17,,,your lowest homework grade will be dropped
18,,,csce 640 students will be expected to solve some slightly more challenging homework problems
19,,,"final grades will be assigned according to this scale: a: 90 and above, b: [80,90), c: [70,80), d:[60,70), f: below 60 a slight curve might be applied if the course average is low"
20,,,late work policy • all assignments must be submitted on canvas 
21,,,• no late submissions will be accepted
22,,,• e-mail submissions will not be accepted and will be ignored without notice
23,,,• work turned -in on time is eligible for partial credit 
24,,,• work submitted by a student as makeup work for an excused absence is not considered late work and is exempted from the late work policy
25,,,(see student rule 7 .
26,,,regarding policy a student can request r egrading of any graded material if the student believes that the points assigned are inconsistent with the quality and merits of the submitted work
27,,,to request re -grading the student needs to follow the guidelines below: 1
28,,,regrading requests must be submitt ed to the instructor within one week after the graded item has been returned to the student
29,,,after this time limit no regrading requests will be honored
30,,,2
31,,,"regrading requests must be in written form, accompanied by a reasonable amount of specific justificat ion and documentation"
