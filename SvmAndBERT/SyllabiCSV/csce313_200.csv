14,,,your sc ore is then reduced by 40 points and becomes 36
15,,,"homework each homework must be accompanied by a written report (if there are multiple parts in the homework, the report applies on ly to the last part) describing your implementation and showing the performance analysis requested in the handout"
16,,,"write in as much detail as possible, explain the various observations, and comment on the sanity of obtained results"
17,,,this course assumes independent work on each assignment
18,,,all submissions must be original and developed from scratch
