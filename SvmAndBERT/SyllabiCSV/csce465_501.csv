6,,,2/8none course learning outcomes this course primarily aims at providing a level of literacy in information security adequate enough to understand the security implications on a number of diverse domains including software engineering; networking; privacy; and policy 
7,,,"a secondary objective is to provide a working knowledge of topics such as cryptography , privacy , network security , and infrastructure management, so that students can acquire the necessary background for more advanced security courses"
8,,,"by the end of this course, students will be able to reason about systems from the perspective of a security engineer "
9,,,"that is, they should be able to deﬁne the system to protect; determine the security properties that are desired for this system; identify the possible threats to these security properties, and their likelihood of occurrence; and consider possible mitigations against these threats"
