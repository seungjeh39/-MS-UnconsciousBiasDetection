2,,,"office: petr 306 office hours: monday, 3-4pm senior grader: venkata sameer kumar betana bhotla grader: ravi pranjal course description this course presents standard techniques for designing algorithms to solve computational problems, proving their correctness, and analyzing their space and runtime requirements"
3,,,np-completeness and hardness reductions will also be covered
4,,,course prerequisites csce 221 and csce 222 course learning outcomes  students will learn about fundamental methods for designing and analyzing algorithms for computational problems
5,,," students will be able to prove correctness and analyze the space and runtime requirements of an algorithm  students will be able to prove a problem is np-complete using appropriate reductions textbook and/or resource materials required textbook: cormen, leiserson, rivest, stein: introduction to algorithms, 3rd edition, the mit press, 2009"
6,,,resources: check canvas multiple times each week for updates
7,,,course syllabus page 2 of 7 grading policy • participation 2% • homework assignments 25% • algorithm history/application essay 3% • midterm 1 23% • midterm 2 23% • final exam 24% the grading scale will be: a ≥ 91% > b ≥ 81% > c ≥ 71% > d ≥ 61% > f
8,,,"if the course average is slow, a slight upward curve may be applied"

10,,,participation grade can be met by in-class participation (e.g.
11,,,"answering questions, presenting answers to in-class activities, answering polling questions), and out-of-class engagement (e.g."
12,,,"answering questions on course messaging boards, submitting intro video)"
13,,,"students can guarantee full points for participation if they satisfy one of the following: (1) uploading an intro video, plus participation in in-class polls on 10 different days, or (2) participating in in-class polls on 20 different days"
14,,,late work and makeup work policy homework
15,,,homework assignments may be submitted up to 24 hours late with a penalty of 25%
16,,,"if it is submitted within 5 hours of the deadline, it will be graded with a smaller penalty of 5% x (number of hours since deadline)"
17,,,work submitted more than 24 hours after the deadline will not be accepted
18,,,(recall that your lowest homework assignment will be dropped.
19,,,tests
20,,,no make-up tests will be given
21,,,"if a student needs to be absent from class on a test day due to an unavoidable and acceptable excused absence, that student needs to get approval from the instructor in advance"
22,,,the absence must be acceptable as defined by tamu’s policy and will require formal verification (e.g.
23,,,a doctor’s note)
24,,,"if any tests are missed, the final grade will be computed using the weighted average of remaining assignments in the course (which includes other tests, homework assignments, and quizzes)"
25,,,"homework policy although it is not required, you are encouraged to work on and complete all homework assignments on your own without consulting peers or outside sources"
26,,,"course syllabus page 3 of 7 you are allowed, under a very specific set of guidelines, to consult outside sources and discuss homework problems with other students"
