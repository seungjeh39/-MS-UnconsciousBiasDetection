9,,,electronic versions are ok
10,,,"(note: it must be the ""arm"" edition, no other edition is usable for this class ) course learning outcomes the goal of this course is to provide the student with a working knowledge of different methods for logic representation, manipulation, and optimization, for both combinational and sequential logic"
11,,,at the end of the course the student should be able to view the design of digital systems from a new perspective and have an understanding of several fundamental concepts that can be applied to a wide variety of digital design problems
12,,,list one or more learning outcomes for the course
13,,,"individual course objectives: at the end of this course, students should: understand the organization of a computer system including the cpu datapath, cpu control, and memory systems understand the impact of semiconductor technology on computer design and architecture"

39,,,i will not curve the individual exams and assignments
40,,,"attendance: students are expected to attend and be active discussion participants during the lectures (answering questions posed, asking questions, commenting etc.)"
41,,,students who attends less than 50% lectures will receive a 0 for this part of their grade
42,,,exams: there will be two exams
43,,,"the second exam will be comprehensive, but with an emphasis on the material covered since the first exam"
44,,,"tentative t est schedule: exam 1 – march 04, 2022 exam 2 – may-09-2022 assignments/quizzes: rather than traditional homework, this course will rely upon a series of on-line quiz assessments"
45,,,the goal of these quizzes will be to test your knowledge of the lecture material and pinpoint which lectures you should go back and review on-line
46,,,"there will be one quiz for each lecture, this quiz must be completed prior to the next lecture"
47,,,students may retake the quiz as many times as desired between its release and the next lecture
48,,,"if the quiz is submitted in the same day as the due time, it will be graded with full credit"
49,,,"if it is delayed by few days (up to a week), you will get 50% grade"
50,,,"otherwise, you will get 0"
51,,,the t amu canvas system will be used for all quiz submissions
52,,,labs: the course will have nine prelabs and nine labs (tentative)
53,,,prelabs are expected to be completed before attending the associated lab session
54,,,"late prelabs will have 50% of the points deducted for being one working day late, more than 2 days late will not be accepted"
55,,,"generally , post-labs and demos must be completed the week following the lab's introduction (the exception being a couple labs that take two weeks)"
56,,,late post-labs will have 20% of the points deducted for being late up to 1-week
57,,,"if a post-lab and/or demo is late for more than a week then, a grade of 0 will be assigned"
58,,,lectures: lectures will be in person in the classroom
59,,,all students are expected to be active participants during lecture
60,,,"course topics/schedule: hours: t opic 3 hours: overview of computer architecture 3 hours: instruction set architectures (isa), representing instructions on the computer , arithmetical and logical instructions, memory access instructions 3 hours: instruction set architectures (isa), control flow instructions, function calls instructions, input- output instructions spim- instruction set simulator 3 hours: computer arithmetic, signed and unsigned numbers, addition and subtraction, multiplication, division, floating point operations 3 hours: t ranslating and starting a program, compilers, compiler optimization, object code generation, assemblers, linking, run-time execution environment 3 hours: performance evaluation, cpu performance and its factors, performance metrics, performance factors, comparing performance, spec benchmarks 2 hours: hardware description languages, v erilog hardware description language, design-simulation process, structural designs in v erilog behavioral hdl description of systems 3 hours: datapath and control, and alu design 3 hours: single-cycle implementation 3 hours: microprogramming, catchup 3 hours: pipelining, pipelined datapath 4 hours: pipelined control, pipeline hazards: structural, control, data hazard detection and resolution, exception handling 4 hours: memory hierarchy , overview of sram and dram design, basic of caches, framework for memory hierarchy , measuring memory performance late w ork policy see above for late policy on quizzes, prelabs and labs"
