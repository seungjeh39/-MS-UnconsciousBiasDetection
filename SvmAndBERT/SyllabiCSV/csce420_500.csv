5,,,ioerger office: 438 peterson building e-mail: ioerger@cs.tamu.ed
6,,,"course description fundamental concepts and techniques of intelligent systems; representation and interpretation of knowledge on a computer; search strategies and control; active research areas and applications such as notational system s, natural language understanding, vision systems, planning algorithms, intelligent agents and expert systems"
7,,,course prerequisites csce 411 or approval of instructor special course designation none course learning outcomes list one or more learning outcomes for the course
8,,,a learning outcome is a statement regarding what the student will know or be able to do upon successfully completing the course
9,,,it must be both observable and measureable
10,,,the outcomes may include competencies developed in the course
11,,,additional assistanc e with learning outcomes is available through the center for teaching excellence and the office of institutional assessment 
12,,,"after completing this class, students should be able to do the following : 1"
13,,,design and implement intelligent search methods for building complex problem -solving programs
14,,,page 2 of 7 1
15,,,formulate computational problems as search tasks 2
16,,,describe how various search algorithms work and explain differences in their space- and time -complexity 3
17,,,design heuristics to improve efficiency of search 2
18,,,use knowledge representation methods for adding knowledge -based reasoning in programs
19,,,1
20,,,be able to encode rules and information in propositional and first -order logic 2
21,,,implement inferenc e algorithms to extract deductions from a knowledge base 3
22,,,represent and reason about uncertainty using bayesian probability 3
23,,,implement intelligent decision -making methods in a program 1
24,,,generate symbolic plans to achieve goals autonomously using planning algorithms 2

31,,,grading policy the overall score for the course will be a weighted combination of the following components: • 50% for 6 assignments (worth 5- 12% each) • 25% for exam i • 25% for exam ii (non -comprehensive) the final grade will be determined from the weighted -average total as follows: • a: 90- 100% • b: ≥ 80% and < 90% • c: ≥ 70% and <8 0% • d: ≥ 60% and <70% • f: < 6 0% grades will be posted on canvas
32,,,late work policy the penalty for late assignments is -5% per day ( pro-rated over 24 hours)
33,,,late work is defined as submitting a deliverable after the established deadline
34,,,work submitted by a student as makeup work for an excused absence is not considered late work and is exempted from the late work policy (see student rule 7 )
35,,,"page 3 of 7 programming assignments in addition to 3 written homeworks, t here will be 3 programming assignments throughout the semester"
36,,,the programming assignments will be done in c++ (individually)
37,,,students are expected to be proficient in c++
38,,,the code for course projects will be submitted via github.tamu.edu
39,,,"students will have to create a (private) repository for this class, and then share that with the instructor and ta by making them collaborators "
40,,,the date and time studen ts turn in each project will be determined by the timestamp of their commits on their files
41,,,it is the student's responsibility to learn how to use git well enough to commit their code ( along with reports and other materials to required turn in) and push i t to the github.tamu.ed
42,,,server by each deadline
