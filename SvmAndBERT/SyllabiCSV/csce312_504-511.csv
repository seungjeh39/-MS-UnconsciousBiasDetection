19,,,t a: sagar adhikari textbook: computer systems: a pr ogrammer's perspective by randal e
20,,,"bryant and david o'hallaron (3rd editon), isbn 978-0134092669 ( note: you have to get the 3rd edition"
21,,,the 2nd edition won't work.
22,,,from the under graduate catalog: csce 312 computer organization credits 4
23,,,3 lectur e hours
24,,,"2 lab hours introduction to computer systems from programmer's perspective: simple logic design, data representation and processor architecture, programming of processors, memory , control ﬂow , input/output, and performance measurements; hands-on lab assignments"
25,,,prerequisites: csce 221 or concurrent enrollment
26,,,junior or senior classiﬁcation or approval of instructor 
27,,,from the professor: think of the computer as an automobile
28,,,"so far , you have begun to learn how to drive, that is, to program the computer in a high-level programming language"
29,,,"but what goes on under the hood? that is, what are the mechanisms underneath the programming language that cause your program to execute? this class will provide an answer to that question"
30,,,you will learn a little about digital logic design
31,,,you will learn how simple electronic devices are linked together to form the complex computer systems we use
32,,,you will see how information is represented and how representations can have an impact on the programs you write
33,,,many of the mysteries behind the sometimes strange behavior of high-level programming languages will be revealed
34,,,"you will learn a very low-level 9/15/22, 3:26 pm csce 312, spring 2022 course information https://people.eng"

36,,,2/3programming language called assembly language that is part of the interface between software and hardware
37,,,"you will learn how details of the implementation of the computer , such as the memory system, can af fect the performance of your programs"
38,,,"when you leave this class, you will have developed an accurate mental model of the way computers work so that when you write programs in a high-level language you will have a good idea of what is really going on when your program runs"
39,,,"thus, you will become a better programmer "
40,,,this class has two big parts: digital logic design and assembly language
41,,,assembly language is the bigger part so we'll do digital logic design ﬁrst
42,,,"there are little parts, too, that we'll pick up along the way"
43,,,about the lab section your teaching assistant will lead a lab covering the topics presented the lecture
44,,,"the t a will administer quizzes, discuss assignments, answer you questions, and in general serve as a resource to give you a better idea of what is going on in the class than your crazy absent-minded professor can"
45,,,course requir ements: homework assignments: (25% of grade)
46,,,"we'll have several homework assignments, many requiring programming"
47,,,quizzes: (20% of grade)
48,,,there will be quizzes in the lab section
49,,,midterm exams: (25% of grade)
50,,,there will be one or two exams during the semester 
51,,,last exam: (30% of grade)
52,,,"there will be a ""last"" exam near the end of the semester "
53,,,grading letter grades will be assigned as follows: a is ≥ 90%; b is ≥ 80%; c is ≥ 70%; d is ≥ 60%; f is < 60%
54,,,policy on assignments and t ests late assignments are not accepted
55,,,"if you have not completed an assignment by the time it is due, turn in what you have for partial credit"
56,,,"make-up tests are generally not given except for university sanctioned reasons, such as religious holidays, documented illnesses, catastrophic events, or other grave situations"
57,,,you must inform the professor before missing the test
58,,,quizzes may not be made up
59,,,"academic dishonesty unless a programming project or problem set is speciﬁcally assigned as a group project, students are not allowed to work together on assignments"
60,,,"you may discuss general ideas related to the assignment, but you may not e.g"
61,,,share program code or read each others writeups
62,,,"instances of such collaboration will be dealt with harshly , but the real cost comes when a student doesn't know how to answer questions on a test about issues involved in doing an assignment"
63,,,"in writing assignments, you may not copy or paraphrase work in whole or in part from other sources without giving proper attribution and making it clear which passages of text are from other sources"
64,,,failure to do so is considered plagiarism
