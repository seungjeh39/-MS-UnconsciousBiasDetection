5,,,"office hours: tbd course description specification and implementation of basic abstract data types and their associated algorithms including stacks, queues, lists, sorting and selection, searching, graphs, and hashing; performance tradeoffs of different implementations and asymptotic analysis of running time and memory usage; includes the execution of student programs written in c++"
6,,,course prerequisites prerequisite is csce 113 or csce 121 as well as honors eligibility
7,,,"corequisite is csce 222 / ecen 222 (that is, you must have already taken this course or be taking it this semester)"
8,,,"course learning outcomes at the end of the semester, the student should be fluent in the use of the basic data structures and their associated algorithms; be familiar with the performance tradeoffs of different implementations of the data structures; understand and apply the principles of abstraction, modularity, and information hiding; appreciate and adhere to good software development practices; and be able to program competently in the subset of c++ covered in the course"

13,,,"page 2 of 6 grading policy your grade will be based on these components: • 30% exams (15% for midterm, 15% for final) • 25% weekly quizzes (12 approx."
14,,,two lowest grades will be dropped) • 30% lab programming assignments (5 approx.
15,,,"• 10% culture report (written report and oral presentation) • 5% participation (class discussion, etc."
16,,,course grades will be assigned according to this scale: % total points 90–100 80–89 70–79 60–69 < 60 letter grade a b c d f late work policy 10% of the maximum possible points will be deducted for each 24 hours that an assignment is late
17,,,"for example, if the assignment is due at midnight on sep 1, and you turn it in any time on sep 2, 10% of the maximum points will be deducted; if you turn it in any time on sep 3, 20% of the maximum points will be deducted; etc"
18,,,"once solutions have been discussed or handed out, the assignment will not be accepted (grade of 0)"
19,,,"make-up assignments will only be available for university-excused absences; see student rule 7, attendance ( http://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07link"
