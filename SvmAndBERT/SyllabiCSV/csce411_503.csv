8,,,(check daily for updates) grading policy your grade will be based on the following components: - exams 60%: there will be one midterm exam and one comprehensive final exam each worth 30%
9,,,the exams will be given in class
10,,,"- quizzes and exercises 10%: there will be online quizzes and exercises, each consisting of a few simple questions"
11,,,your lowest grade in this component will be dropped
12,,,"- homework 30% : these are essay style assignments, for which you are required to use the latex typesetting system to type in your answers"
13,,,all assignments can be found in canvas 
14,,,your lowest homework grade will be dropped
15,,,"final grades will be assigned according to th is scale: a: 90 and above, b: [80,90), c: [70,80), d: [60,70), f: below 60 a slight curve might be applied if the course average is low"
16,,,late work policy • all assignments must be submitted on canvas 
17,,,• no late submissions will be accepted
18,,,• e-mail submissions will not be accepted and will be ignored without notice
19,,,• work turned -in on time is eligible for partial credit 
20,,,• work submitted by a student as makeup work for an excused absence is not considered la te work and is exempted from the late work policy
21,,,(see student rule 7 .
22,,,regr ading policy a student can request regrading of any graded material if the student believes that the points assigned are inconsistent with the quality and merits of the submitted work
23,,,to request re -grading the student needs to follow the guidelines below: 1
24,,,regrading requests must be submitted to the instructor within one week after the graded item has been retu rned to the student
25,,,after this time limit no regrading requests will be honored
26,,,2
27,,,"regrading requests must be in written form, accompanied by a reasonable amount of specific justification and documentation"
