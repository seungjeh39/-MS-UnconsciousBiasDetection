2,,,"locking, concurrency, scheduling, communication across networks, fault tolerance) behind the design of distributed processing systems, such as google, facebook, amazon, yahoo and microsoft, and to gain practical experience designing, implementing, and debugging real distributed systems"
3,,,hnr students will work on a class project
4,,,"prerequisites: csce 313 and senior/junior classification, or approval of instructor"
5,,,"learning outcomes or course objectives at the end of this course, you will understand the following aspects of a distributed system, in no particular order: ● implement and structure distributed systems programs ● write programs that can interoperate using well-defined protocols ● use standard network communication primitives such as udp and tcp ● employ and create common paradigms for easing the task of distributed systems programming"
6,,,"be able to clearly elucidate their benefits, drawbacks, and limitations"
7,,,"● debug highly concurrent code that spans multiple programs running on multiple machines ● reason about distributed algorithms for locking, synchronization and concurrency, scheduling, and replication students in 438h will investigate distributed ledger, smart contracts and blockchain, will be stimulated to propose new ideas for addressing existing problems and write a report"
