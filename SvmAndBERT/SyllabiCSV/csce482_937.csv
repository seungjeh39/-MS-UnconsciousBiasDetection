15,,,detailed course description cpsc 48 2 is a project -oriented course aimed at developing system integration skills
16,,,students work in groups of 3-5 people to complete a significant engineering design project
17,,,"every project requires complete implementation, documentation and demonstration of a computing system design with both hardware and software components"
18,,,"the focus is not only on the final product but also on desig n methodology, management process and teamwork"
19,,,each team will be required to manage its own efforts to complete its proje ct in a timely manner
20,,,group members will be required to keep individual lab notebooks recording their efforts and their personal impressions of the project
21,,,students will be graded based on both the quality of the group product and their individual contri butions
22,,,"every team will be required to schedule a weekly meeting with the course instructor and the tas, preferably during the off icial class or lab hours"
23,,,these meetings must be attended by every group member
24,,,"since the projects will be student managed , the exact nature and style of these meetings is at the group’s discretion"
25,,,"however, every member of the group is expected to partic ipate "
26,,,"at the end of the semester, each group will make a public presentation describing and demonstrating their work"
27,,,the se presentations will be open to the university community
28,,,course objectives to prepare students for engineering practice with a major design experience based on the knowledge and skills acquired in earlier course work and incorporating en gineering standards and realistic constraints that include most of the following considerations: economic; environmental; sustainability; manufac turability; ethical; health and safety; social; and political
29,,,expected outcomes it is expected that successful participation in the course will allow the student to demonstrate: • analyze a complex computing problem and to apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions
30,,,"• design, implement, and evaluate a com puting -based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program’s discipline"
31,,,• communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts
32,,,• recognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgments in computing practice based on legal and ethical principles
33,,,• function effectively as a member or leader of a team engaged in activities appropriate to the program’s discipline
34,,,1
35,,,apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing -based solutions
36,,,grading policy the final grade you will receive in the class will be based on points accumulated during the semester
37,,,"thus, both continued progress (the process) and the quality of your product (and other deliverables) will determine your grade"
38,,,"although the bulk of your grade is based on the performance of your team, individual performance will also be gauged"
39,,,"1 project proposal ( 5%): these points will be based on (1) the originality, creativity and feasibility of the proposed work, the analysis of alternative solutions, the consideration of economic and societal aspects, the project management approach ( 3%), and (2) the quality of the oral presenta tion (2%)"
40,,,a template for the proposal report and a presentation rubric are available on the course webpage
41,,,3 critical design review (10%) : the cdr is a mid -semester evaluation of your project
42,,,"the grade will be based on your progress to date, and the qu ality of the oral presentation and accompanying written report"
43,,,a template for the cdr report and a presentation rubric are available on the course webpage 
44,,,"4 final communication (15%): this grade will be based on the quality of the final presentation (5%), as well as the contents and professional finish of the documentation (10%)"
45,,,a template for the final report and a presentation rubric are available on the course webpage
46,,,2 weekly p rogress (10%): this grade will be based on your team’s ability to mai ntain the project on schedule
47,,,"the weekly report should be incremental , and should specifically address the following: a"
48,,,agenda for the weekly meeting with the instructor and the ta b
49,,,"any major accomplishments during this time period , including figu res and results c"
50,,,an overview of the plan of work for the following two weeks d
51,,,"an update on project management, including teamwork, purchases, schedule and milestone status e"
52,,,minutes of the previous meeting weekly progress reports are due two h ours prior to the time of the weekly meeting
53,,,the responsibility of preparing these reports will be rotated among team members
54,,,"the team member preparing the report will also be in char ge of facilitating the discussions during that weekly meeting, and pre paring an action list for the following week"
55,,,the action list contains the set of specific goals that each team member gas agreed to complete and a deadline for completing them
56,,,"5 project grade (20%): a final grade will be assigned to your project based on the completion of all the objectives stated in the proposal, as well as on a live demonstration in front of the class"
57,,,the complexity of your project and the size of your team w ill be factored in
58,,,due date: project demonstrations will take place 48 ho urs prior to the final presentation (or the friday prior if on a weekend)
59,,,this earlier deadline for the demo ensures that teams have time to prepare the final communication and fina l presentation
60,,,for items 1 -5: using github sites for your group and gra ding purposes: i.team
61,,,will use the tamu enterprise github to organize and trace course progress and materials
62,,,all ii.require
63,,,"group materials such as project proposal, weekly report, cdr, final report and presentation files, iii.shoul"
64,,,be shared on the github
65,,,"a lso, the activity log of the github will be used to access how each iv.individua"
66,,,contributed to the team as well
67,,,tea ms should make use of github features such as the v.readm
68,,,and wiki in order to provide documentation for their project
69,,,6 teamwork (10 %); it is very important to understand that accomplishing the technical objectives of the project is not sufficient
70,,,these accomplishments should not come at the expense of destroying relationships among team members
71,,,"thus, a grade will be assigned based on t he ability of the group to function as a team"
72,,,is there evidence that the group engaged in team building activities? were contributions to the project evenly distributed? were members equally engaged in discussions during meetings? was there an effective division of responsibilities? the project grade is direct outcome of teamwork
73,,,teamwork score is no more than the project grade in 5
74,,,"among the 10%, i"
75,,,2% is given to the teamwork quiz and ii
76,,,8% is determined by final evaluation of teamwork effectiveness
77,,,teamwork grade level cannot be higher than project grade
78,,,7 individua l performance (30%): points in this category are awarded based on assessments of your personal contribution to the team efforts: a
79,,,notebook ( 5%): you are required to record what you do as a member of the project
80,,,entries in the notebook should be made during or shortly after every work session
81,,,"each entry should include (1) the date, (2) the objectives for that session, and (3) record of what was done"
82,,,a grade will be assigned to your personal design notebook based on: i
83,,,the regularity of your entries throughout the semester
84,,,ii
85,,,"the evidence of an engineering design process, including but not limited to schematics, block diagrams, circ uits, pseudo -code, tables of experiment al results, and mathematical derivations"
86,,,iii
87,,,"the clarity, legibility and organization of your annotations"
88,,,you can choose either paper -based notebook or electronic -based notebook: paper -based notebooks must have permanent binding (i.e.
89,,,"composi tion pads); spiral -bound notebooks will not be accepted , failing to do so will result in a 5% penalty on the final grade"
90,,,electronic notebook can be either word file or pdf file
91,,,the file should clearly co ntain aforementioned materials in an organized mann er
92,,,the file should be cumulative which contain s all the information from the beginning of the class
93,,,b
94,,,"participation ( 4%): the instructor and ta will evaluate your attendance to meetings, participation in the discussions, and contributions to the team"
95,,,"team leaders will instead be evaluated by their ability to make the group operate as a team, i.e."
96,,,item (6) above
97,,,c
98,,,peer review ( 9%): your performance will be evaluated by each of your team members throughout the semester
99,,,there are three pe er reviews throughout the semester
100,,,d
101,,,github insights (10%): all projects will be hosted on tamu’s enterprise github (github.
102,,,amu.edu)
103,,,"all project code should be managed, from the project beginning, in this system"
104,,,"through proper version control techn iques, your individual work history on the project will be documented"
105,,,you will be required to maintain a stable master project b ranch by implementing features on separate working branches and creating pull requests for the entire team to review and merge into the master branch
106,,,you will be assigned a grade for your github contributions based on: i
107,,,(3%) the regularity of your commit history throughout the semester
108,,,"for example, if you only submit codes at the last week of semester, you will lose the three po ints"
109,,,ii
110,,,(4%) the quality and quantity of code and documentation you committed to the project throughout the semester
111,,,"note: code quality including metrics such as structure, readability, and efficiency will be weighted more heavily than the number of lines o f code committed"
112,,,iii
113,,,"(4%) adherence to good version control prac tices such as using branches to develop new features without affecting the master branch, avoiding bundling unrelated changes into single commits, and writing good commit messages"
114,,,e
115,,,online cou rse about ethics (2%) : we will provide an online ethics cours e in canvass
116,,,f
117,,,autodrive challenge participation extra credit (max 5%): all projects this semester are facilitated through the texas a&m unmanned team as part of the gm/sae autodrive challen ge
118,,,"throughout the semester, there may be opportunities to contribute to the team beyond what is required as part of the course requirements e.g"
119,,,preparing or presenting team reports for the autodrive competition
120,,,students may be offered extra credit for v olunteering for such tasks in proportion t o the effort required
121,,,"note : grades will not be assigned until all project deliverables have been turned in (see below), all borrowed items (e.g."
122,,,"keys, books, equipment) have been returned to their proper locati on or their owner, and the workstations in the lab have been thoroughly cleaned up"
123,,,all team members are required to be present at the time of the final delivery unless due to excused absence allowed by student rule 7
