20,,,"●every semester is different, every team is different, every solution is different.ther"
21,,,is alwayssomething new to learn and innovate
22,,,●smaller class sizes and weekly meetings allow you to connectwith your classmates and yourinstructor
23,,,"page1of15 course s yllabus course expectations inclusion statementin this class, we are committed to a culture of inclusivity"
24,,,"we reject and condemn all forms of racism,discrimination, brutality, and violence"
25,,,"we actively promote diversity and inclusion within our field notlimited to race, ethnicity, religion, disability, age, sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation"
26,,,"thus, we areunited in our condemnation of racism and any form of injustice"
27,,,as martin luther king jr
28,,,"said, “injusticeanywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."
29,,,"if any student wishes to discuss anything regardinginclusivity within the classroom, especially anything contrary to this statement that you haveexperienced, you are encouraged to contact the ta or instructor"
30,,,"we also endeavor to make the coursematerials themselves inclusive and accessible, and we encourage you to contact the ta or instructor ifyou have any concerns or questions regarding class materials"
31,,,"about working in teamsbecause your teammates' grades are so tightly coupled with your own dedication to the class, many ofthe assignments and rules are put in place to protect you and your teammates"
32,,,"these includerequirements to participate actively in class, complete assignments in a timely manner, keep the videoon with your face visible in virtual meetings, and treat your classmates and instructors with respect"
33,,,csce 482 is a project-oriented course aimed at developing system integration skills
34,,,you will work ingroups of 4–5 people to complete a significant software design project
35,,,"every project requires you tocomplete implementation, documentation, evaluation, and demonstration of a software system"
36,,,"thefocus is not only on the final product but also on design methodology, management process, andteamwork"
37,,,each team is required to accommodate the following: ●time management:manage its own efforts to completeits project in a timely manner
38,,,you aregraded based on both the quality of the group product and their individual contributions
39,,,●scheduled meetings:schedule a weekly meeting withthe course instructor and the tas duringthe official class hours
40,,,these meetings must be attended by every group member
41,,,"since theprojects will be student managed, the exact nature and style of these meetings is at the group’sdiscretion, e.g."
42,,,division of tasks among group members.however
43,,,every member of the group is expected to participate in these meetings .a
44,,,"the end of the semester, each group will make a public presentation describing and demonstratingtheir work"
45,,,these presentations are open to the university community
46,,,"page2of15 course s yllabus online elementswe will use canvas for course materials, assignments, and communication"
47,,,"while most materials andassignments will be handled online, the class itself will be held in-person and synchronously, whichmeans you are required to be present and active during all classes and all class times"
48,,,"if remotelyattending for an approved reason, we will require attendees to have your video on with your face visible"
49,,,attendance policystudents required to quarantine or self-isolate should still participate in courses and course-relatedactivities remotely and must not attend face-to-face course activities
50,,,students under quarantine orself-isolation are expected to participate in courses and complete graded work unless they havesymptoms that are too severe to participate in course activities
51,,,instructors teaching courses deliveredonly face-to-face should work closely with students who are in quarantine or self-isolation to ensure thestudent keeps up with the work
52,,,"students experiencing personal injury or illness that is too severe for the student to attend class qualifyfor an excused absence (seestudent rule 7, section7.2.2)"
53,,,"to receive an excused absence, studentsmust comply with the documentation and notification guidelines outlined in student rule 7"

55,,,"indicates a medical confirmation note from the student’s medicalprovider is preferred, please be understanding as not all illnesses may require a visit to a physician,especially during this time"
56,,,●importance of attendance:not attending weekly meetingsharms the other members of yourgroup and makes it much more difficult for the instructor to assess your contributions to thegroup effort
57,,,"therefore, attendance, punctuality and active participation in the weekly meetingsare required"
58,,,"due to the unfortunate consequences and undue burden your frequent absenceswould have on the rest of the team,more than 5 unexcusedabsences is an automatic failure"
59,,,"●video presence:if you are attending this class online,then you are required to have your videoshowing your face"
60,,,"just as it is not appropriate to attend a face-to-face class with a blanket overyour head, it is not appropriate to attend class with your video off"
61,,,"if you need to use a bio breakor step away briefly, you will need to communicate this with your team as long as an estimatewhen you will return"
62,,,"this class has a significant communication component, and facialexpressions are vital to communication"
63,,,"we understand that you may have a “bad hair day” orsome other reason that you will need to keep your video off, and those are completely fine"
64,,,justnote thathaving your video off will count as oneof your unexcused absences
65,,,●absence and tardiness:failure to attend a meetingor late arrivals (more than 10 minutes late)will be reflected in your individual grade
66,,,"emergencies, however, do happen"
67,,,lateness or absencecan be excused if there is a valid reason
68,,,"illness, job interviews out of town, death in the family,conference attendance, inclement weather or accidents for commuters, etc."
69,,,are valid reasons
70,,,"●valid excuses:oversleeping, a term paper due, anexam to cram for, etc."
71,,,are not valid reasons.ultimately
