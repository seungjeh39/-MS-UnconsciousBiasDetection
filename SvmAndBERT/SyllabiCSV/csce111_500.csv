1,,,"csce 111: introduction to computer science , spring 2022 department of computer science and engineering, texas a&m university © 2016 –2022 robert lightfoot page 1 of 12 csce 111 introduction to programming concepts course syllabus wait a minute what are all of these non -computer science majors doing taking this class? i am about to reach over 1 500 students this semester in this class"
2,,,why are students taking this and why are other majors requiring it? the use of computers in every industry makes this a very good reason
3,,,"required for all students? throughout many college careers, there are classes that are required for every major"
4,,,there are people that believe one or t wo computer science classes should be included in this list
5,,,"like english (in an english speaking location) is required to be able to communicate with people, more and more, we need to communicate with machines"
6,,,computer science classes can help with that
7,,,why do i teach this there are a lot of reasons this is a class i chose to teach:  i think it is fun to see a machine do exactly what i command
8,,, i think it is more fun to see students realize this is very doable
9,,, i enjoy the challenge and the reward of your success 
10,,, i have had a fantastic career developing software
11,,," i think there is so much more to come, i want to help others get ready"
12,,," with such a large base of software now, one can focus on their specialty and not have to be a “computer scientist” to make good use of computing"
13,,, java is a fun language to teach
14,,,what ’s next ? students completing this course should be able to:  feel comfortable using a computer
15,,,"csce 111: introduction to computer science , spring 2022 department of computer science and engineering, texas a&m university © 2016 –2022 robert lightfoot page 2 of 12  use java to produce software"
16,,," understand programming in other settings, like excel or javascript "
17,,, feel comfortable changing their major to computer science
18,,,"course overview the computer’s role in culture has expanded from a calculating machine used by governments to the ipod as a fashion accessory, the smart phone as a compani on, and the internet as a medium of self -expression"
19,,,"in the 1950s, the idea of dedicating a computer to entertainment was unthinkable; today revenues from the computer game industry exceed hollywood"
20,,,"more humans own a computer than own a toothbrush and apple is one of the world’s largest company having overtaken many oil, agriculture, and manufacturing sectors "
21,,,we inhabit a century where every job will be technical
22,,,"in the 21st century, learning to program a computer is empowerment"
23,,,"from “if” conditionals t o “for” loops, knowing the basics of programming allows you to understand the way the modern world works"
24,,,"programming instruction teaches procedural and functional thinking, project management and time management, skills that are essential components of an empowered individual"
25,,,"programming is the power to create, the power to change, and the power to influence"
26,,,today’s students regardless of their ultimate field of study or occupation need this fundamental knowledge
27,,,"programming teaches logic, algorithmic t hinking, and an iterative approach to solving problems and testing your ideas"
28,,,these skills make you smarter and are useful no matter what you do
29,,,"learning to program can be incredibly rewarding, give you a new appreciation for technology, and introduce co untless career opportunities"
30,,,"catalog description using computation to enhance problem -solving abilities; understanding how people communicate with computers, and how computing affects society; computational thinking; software design principles, including algorithm design, data representation, abstraction, modularity, structured and object -oriented programming, documentation, testing, portability, and maintenance; understanding programs’ abilities and limitations; development and execution of programs"

56,,,there are a total of 1500 point s available to earn
57,,,you need 105 0 or more to get an a
58,,,"unlike the traditional 90% or 1350 points , you can choose from different assignments with different values to get your points"
59,,,you can choose the point level you want to achieve and know the grade you have earned base on the items you have shown mastery towards
60,,,"to show mastery in a topic, you must achieve 70% or greater"
61,,,otherwise no credit is given for that topic
62,,,the grading s cale expected to be used is: a >= 1050 points > b >= 950 points > c >= 850 points d >= 750 points > f < 750 points the main path includes 4 categories 
63,,,a student must get 70% on each of the main assignment groups to get a c or better in the class

85,,,many of these are a great way to build a solid base of points that will get you the grade you want
86,,,engagement and participation: engagement counts for 100 points 
87,,,"historically in my classes, those students who get full credit for engagement make the highest grades"
88,,,"those who get less than full credit, down to zero credit, do not make the highest grades"
89,,,each week you will have several opportunities to show your engagement 
90,,,this is one of the best ways to earn points
