(in office) or by appointment (in office or by zoom) course description this course examines law and policy issues related to cybersecurity for the spectrum of cybersecurity jobs including those defined in the nist nice framework (procurement, operations/maintenance, governance and oversight, protection/defense, analysis, intelligence collection/operation; and investigation) cybersecurity jobs
tomorrow’s cyber workers are exposed to more data and privacy issues that requ ires them to analyze law, policies, and regulations both under united states jurisdiction and internation al jurisdiction (spoiler alert: the internet has changed our traditional notion of jurisdiction!) 
law is traceable and based on precedent while techn ology is disruptive
course syllabus page 2 of 15 the course first examines the fundamentals and basics of law – jurisdiction, due diligence, case/controversy, standing, statute of limitations, remedies/damages, and evidence standards – to establish a foundation to apply and analyze legal issues that are especially problematic regarding cybersecurity
the course then explores the national and international legal frameworks that govern cybersecurity and their implications for attacks, motives, responses, and counte r-attacks through the lens of what is permissible against attacking individuals or entities versus attacking nation -states including legal issues such as “hacking back” and problems such as accurate attack attribution
the course then examines the legal i ssues raised by the cloud related to privacy and third partie s including emerging standards
the overarching goal of this course is to provide a cyber -worker in technical, business or policy domains with the knowledge and skills to better interpret threats and responses in a national and international law framework while understanding (and being sympathetic to) the limits of the current law and how law/policy can evolve for cybersecurity
this course is not intended to make you lawyers, but rather legal -savvy cyber workers
the course includes current events discussion on relevant information and relies on extensive analysis of laws and policies whereby students will demonstrate their knowledge and skills by preparing short written assignments throughout the semester
special course designation this is a stacked course
