e du o office hours: tbd course description • csce 120: extend prior programming knowledge to create computer programs that solve problems; use the c++ language; apply computational thinking to enhance problem solving; analyze, design and implement computer programs; use basic and aggregate data types to develop functional and object -oriented solutions; develop classes that use dynamic memory and avoid memory leaks; learn error handling strategies to develop more secure and robust prog rams
course prerequisites • csce 120: grade of c or better in e ngr 102 , csce 110 , csce 111 , or csce 206 , or equivalent
• csce 121: programming course (high school or college)
course learning outcomes upon completion of the course students should be able to: • use c++ to develop programs 
• represent algorithm designs as pseudocode or other appropriate representations
o abstraction o information hiding o object -oriented decomposition • list common data types used in computer programs
• descr ibe when each aggregate data type is appropriate
• use strategies that address errors in programs
diversity equity and inclusion accessibility statements michael moore's accessibility statement while the new disability accommodation portal (aim portal) will ease sharing accommodation information, you must still make an appointment with me to discuss your accommodations
however, the university requires that i only provide accommodations for students registered with disability resources 
in fact, i teach a course on accessible computing which focuses on principles for creating accessible applications and programs
philip ritchey's accessibility statement i recognize disability as an aspect of diversity, equity, and inclusion
however, i realize that some aspects of the course may not yet be as inclusive as they could be
if you have already established accommodations with disability resources, please activate your accommodations via aim portal ( click here to access the aim portallinks to an external site
if you have not yet established services through disability resources, but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations (conditions include but not limited to; mental health, attention- related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health impacts), contact disability resources directly to set up an accessibility plan

brennen taylor's accessibility statement inclusivity is important to me, and i commit to making all course materials as accessible as i can
in addition, at the very least, shoot me an email and make we aware of your accommodations so i can be aware and work with you
