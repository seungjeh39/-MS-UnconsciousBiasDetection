 gain knowledge on anti -analysis techniques to protect binaries
textbook and/or resource materials ● none required ● reference books (not exclusive) ● assembly language for intel based computers, by irvine ● the ida pro book, by chris eagle ● reverse engineering, secret of reverse engineering, by eldad eilam ● practical malware analysis, by m
sikorski and a
honig ● open literature, vendors technical information (intel, microsoft) ● a laptop computer with sufficient performance to run a designated linux virtual machine, compilers and re tools
the laptop should also have large hdd space and main memory
past experience suggests that common laptops would be usable for class activities, but lack of computing resources can significantly affect the productivity or even classwork outcomes
linux and compilers , various utility tools grading policy • labs, exercises, assignments 40% • tests 40% course syllabus page 3 of 8 • final project 20% • the grading scale : by numerical ranking of total scores
