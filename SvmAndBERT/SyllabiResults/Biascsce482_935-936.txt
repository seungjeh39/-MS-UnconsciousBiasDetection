** this course is evaluated every year through the abet (accreditation board for engineering and technology) accreditation process , which provides assurance that a college or university program meets the quality standards of the profession , by doing the following: ● verifies that your educational experience meets the global standard for technical education in your profession
● enhances your employment opportunities —multinational corporations require graduation from an accredited program
● supports your entry to a technical profession through licensure, registration and certification —all of which often require graduation from an abet -accredited program as a minimum qualification
● establishes your eligibility for many federal student loans, grants, and/or scholarships
● paves the way for you to work globally , because abet accreditation is recognized worldwide through international agreements, and many other countries’ national accrediting systems are based on the abet model
to comply with abet , students must demonstrate their abilities in outcomes above, which will be evaluated by external industrial affiliate members during your fin al presentation

grading policy the final grade you will receive in the class will be based on points accumulated during the semester
thus , both continued progress (the process) and the quality of your product (and other deliverables) will determine your grade
the grading scale is as follows: f < 60% ≤ d < 70% ≤ c < 80% ≤ b < 90% ≤ a we do not curve in this class, however provide you with the opportunity to earn an a , hence an 89.
is a b 
we teach to mastery which means that we have clear expectations in terms of what you should complete and what kno wledge you should have obtained by the end of the course to succeed and to earn an a
peer review 1% 3
peer feedback 1% 4
report progress 18% 9
final deliverables: 30% 10
quiz 2% ----------------------------------------------- total 100% important note s: • you will not receive a passing grade in the class if you do not have a tested working system by the due date
the lower weighted items will significantly help you succeed in your higher- weighted items
instructors will base their assessment on one or more of the following: class attendance, punctuality, participation during class, timely submission of assignme nts/deliverables, peer feedback results, other informal senior capstone – csce 482 course syllabus page 5 of 13 feedback from teammates or tas , and other actions which positively/negatively contribute to the success of the team
• any team member who does not participate adequately, after interventions have been attempted , will automatically get at least 1 letter grade below the lowest grade of any of the team members 1
the group reports typically communicate the team’s accomplishments the previous period, which need to be measurable 
team members should all be involved in taking meeting minutes, submitting team reports and reporting during the weekly meeting
2
depending on the circumstances, you may not be given credit for peer feedback more than 3 days late, since this feedback is the basis for assessing team member s’ contribution or participation 
regardless of whether you get credit or not, your final grade cannot be finalized until you complete all of your peer feedback 
ethics (2%) the grading criteria is related on completion of the e thics training and corresponding quizzes 
project management (3%) you are expected to choose a software engineering process model and create the corresponding artifacts 
for example, if the team chooses to use agile scrum, then expected artifacts are spri nt & product backlogs, user stories , etc 
project testing (20%) internal testing (10%), you are expected to test that the expected deliverables of th e project meet implicit and explicit (e.g.
functionality) requirements
expectations include developing automat ed test suite, multi -phase testing ( unit / integration / system testing )
definition of success is related to how well you prepared and impleme nted your evaluation plan, to meet your team’s quality goals (e.g.
senior capstone – csce 482 course syllabus page 6 of 13 user acceptance testing (10%): at least 20 participants this evaluates how well you prepared and executed user acceptance test , including submission of the user acceptance test results 
note that your grade cannot be finalized unless you complete user acceptance test
references (1%) & related work (1%) to ensure that you have a strong understanding of existing relevant work you will per form a literature review of related works to y our team project
each team member is expected to identify 5 relevant papers for their project to be referenced in their final report
you should describe your minimum viable project and any additional goals you may have
design (2%) the design part of your methodology should clearly describe what your solution seeks to achieve, what the user experience will be, what tools you will use, and what challenges you will face
you should describe your minimum viable project and any additional goals you ma y have
fi nal deliverables (30%) final report ( 3%), github documentation & code/result (20%), demo video & video release (5%) , other deliverables (2%) this indicates how well you completed your final deliverables
d
evaluation (e.g.
internal and user acceptance test) materials g
audiovisual media: close -up pictures of your system , high -quality video of your project (including a system demo and a project description) for posterity

see next section on purchases & reimbursements m
facilit ies used by the project team have been thoroughly cleaned up note : grades will not be assigned until all project deliverables have been turned in 
all team members are required to participate in making sure deliverables are completed and delivered
submitting an incomplete po will result in the team being prevented from submitting additional pos; and all additional purchases will have to be made by team members themselves and will be reimbursed at the end of the semester
if the vendor only h as a few units left)
if you suspect that a critical item may become backordered, it may be better if you purchase it directly since pos may take several days to go through
● reimbursements deadline: reimbursement requests are due at the time of final deliv erables
overnight or express delivery will not be reimbursed unless app roved in advance by the instructor
● equipment return: the equipment and ma terials that you purchase do not belong to you, they belong to texas a&m university
before you will be given a final grade in the course, all equipment and materials must be returned

you will receive a review from your instructors and peers that you must address in order to receive credit
checkpoints and demo of system progress refer to informal presentations on specific deliverables with the purpose of assessing progress

external reviewers expect that you have the ability communicate the skills or knowledge you acquired in your undergraduate studies
class attendance importance of attendance: not attending weekly class meetings harms the other members of your group and makes it much more difficult for the instructor to assess your contributions to the group effort
due to the undue burden your frequent absences have on the rest of the team, more than 5 unexcused absences are an automatic failure 
upon instructors’ discretion, arriving to class late (> 10 minutes late) , leaving early (> 10 minu tes before class end) , and/ or not participating (e.g.
not taking a quiz, not being present for a status meeting, not submitting in class work, and/or doing work not related to the class) can be considered an unexcused absence, depending on the circumstanc es
oversleeping, a term paper due, an exam to cram for, etc.
are not valid reasons
ultimately, the instructor reserves the right to determine what constitutes a “valid reason” on a case - by-case basis
note that days in which teams may need to work in a remote location to accomplish certain assignments (e.g.
do not count toward absences providing they are approve d by the instructor in advance, abide by the instructor’s requirements for check in during course time, abide by any activity reporting requirements by the instructor, and complete all assignments on -time relevant to that class time
students experiencing personal injury or illness that is too severe for the student to attend class qualify for an excused absence (see student rule 7, section 7.2.
) assuming that documentation and notification guidelines are followed
graded wo rk is expected to be completed unless symptoms are too severe
late work policy late work policy is defined as submitting a deliverable after the established deadline
work submitted by a student as makeup work for an excused absence , according to student rule 7 is not considered late work and is exempted from the late work policy
if you feel that you have a valid reason for submitting late work, even if it is not related to student rule 7, submit a request to excuse the late submission in advance of the deadline (3 business days is strongly recommended)
we will carefully review your request and will either approve or disapprove the request (with fairness and equity in mind) , if the request has been submitted in a timely manner
