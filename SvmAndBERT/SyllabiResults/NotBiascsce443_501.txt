 course description aesthetic and technical aspects of computer game development, including game mechanics, story development, content creation and game programming; includes game design, interface design, 3d modeling and animation, graphics algorithms, shader programming and artificial intelligence; group project includes the design and development of a game from start to finish
during this course students will become familiar with the game development process as it applies in game development companies
the course is structured around the development of a core game, while many prototypes are being developed to prove out theories, assumptions, playability and fun factor
at the end of the course students will have created a playable demo
understand the development process for game play, game mechanics and game ai 3
implement a variety of prototypes 4
create game content 5
critique different project management strategies textbook and/or resource materials handouts as provided remote engagement expectations (in case it is required) • students are engaged during the designated class time
this is not a self -paced course
• students will actively engage in discussion, online chats, polls, and other activities throughout the entire class session during all remote sessions
any activities conducted during class will count toward participation points
