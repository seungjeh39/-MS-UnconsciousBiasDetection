 course s yllabus csce 482-932, senior capstone designinstructor tracy hammond, ta adrita anika course ov ervieweffective design requires identifying the “right” problem to solve, building components that meet thatproblem’s needs, and integrating components into a single solution system
as problems become morechallenging, solid design, follow through, and teamwork skills become necessary to developing asolution
you will work in groups of 4-5 people to complete a significant engineering design project
every projectrequires complete implementation, documentation, evaluation, and demonstration of a computingsystem design
the focus is not only on the final product but also on design methodology, managementprocess, and teamwork
at the end of the semester, each group will make a public presentationdescribing and demonstrating their work
this course offers you a unique learning experience
●this is an opportunity for you to try to solve a problem that matters to you.thi
course givesyou a lot of freedom and choice in your semester-long project
this course can be the first steptowards moving to the career of your choice
●building a system from start to finish is fun and rewarding.student
often tell me that this wasthe greatest experience of their entire college career
●working on teams can be messy, but it’s worth it.i
is amazing what you can accomplishtogether, so much more than on your own
working on real problems with real people has itschallenges, but it is also very rewarding when you successfully complete your goals
●every semester is different, every team is different, every solution is different.ther
is alwayssomething new to learn and innovate
●smaller class sizes and weekly meetings allow you to connectwith your classmates and yourinstructor
page1of15 course s yllabus course expectations inclusion statementin this class, we are committed to a culture of inclusivity
we reject and condemn all forms of racism,discrimination, brutality, and violence
said, “injusticeanywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.
we also endeavor to make the coursematerials themselves inclusive and accessible, and we encourage you to contact the ta or instructor ifyou have any concerns or questions regarding class materials
about working in teamsbecause your teammates' grades are so tightly coupled with your own dedication to the class, many ofthe assignments and rules are put in place to protect you and your teammates
csce 482 is a project-oriented course aimed at developing system integration skills
you will work ingroups of 4–5 people to complete a significant software design project
every project requires you tocomplete implementation, documentation, evaluation, and demonstration of a software system
thefocus is not only on the final product but also on design methodology, management process, andteamwork
●scheduled meetings:schedule a weekly meeting withthe course instructor and the tas duringthe official class hours
since theprojects will be student managed, the exact nature and style of these meetings is at the group’sdiscretion, e.g.
division of tasks among group members.however
the end of the semester, each group will make a public presentation describing and demonstratingtheir work
these presentations are open to the university community
page2of15 course s yllabus online elementswe will use canvas for course materials, assignments, and communication
if remotelyattending for an approved reason, we will require attendees to have your video on with your face visible
whilestudent rule 7, section 7.3.2.1
●importance of attendance:not attending weekly meetingsharms the other members of yourgroup and makes it much more difficult for the instructor to assess your contributions to thegroup effort
due to the unfortunate consequences and undue burden your frequent absenceswould have on the rest of the team,more than 5 unexcusedabsences is an automatic failure
if you need to use a bio breakor step away briefly, you will need to communicate this with your team as long as an estimatewhen you will return
justnote thathaving your video off will count as oneof your unexcused absences
●absence and tardiness:failure to attend a meetingor late arrivals (more than 10 minutes late)will be reflected in your individual grade
emergencies, however, do happen
illness, job interviews out of town, death in the family,conference attendance, inclement weather or accidents for commuters, etc.
●proper planning:if you know you are going to be lateor miss a class, please let the instructor and your teammates know,so that they may plan foryour absence and make the best use oftheir time

this class is part of the holistic evaluation
abet accreditationprovides assurance that a college or university program meets the quality standards of the profession forwhich that program prepares graduates
your degree is a significant achievement and perhaps the largestinvestment you will make toward your future
●establishes your eligibilityfor many federal studentloans, grants, and/or scholarships
each of thoseskills will be evaluated by external industrial affiliate members during your final presentation
grading p olicythe final grade you will receive in the class will bebased on points accumulatedduring the semester.thus
both continued progress (the process) and the quality of your product (and other deliverables) willdetermine your grade
although the bulk of your grade is based on the performance of your team,individual performance will also be gauged
the following is the breakdown of the gradingpolicy
quizzes:3% page6of15 course s yllabus 2.pee
proposal:5%4.weekl
reports:5%5.readin
deliverables:5%8.projec
testing:5%9.ir
materials:5%10.use
the lower weighted items will significantly help you succeed in yourhigher-weighted items
daily quizzes (3%)every class (including the first class) will start with a 10-minute quiz
the quizzes will include materialabout your assignments, questions about your design choices, and knowledge that you should havegained from your past computer science courses
research has repeatedly shown that the act ofquizzing imparts more knowledge than lecturing or studying
this course is your final course in your computerscience degree, and should provide you with the capability to put all of your skills together andcommunicate those capabilities effectively
2
peer feedback (2%)peer feedback is crucial
you will be asked to givefeedback to your peers regularly throughout the semester
this includes feedback on their presentations,their proposal ideas, and their written work
3
project proposal (5%)initial individual proposal (1%), final individual proposal (1%), group proposal(3%)this grading criteria focus on formulating iterations of potential project ideas that will eventually lead toyour team’s final project idea for the rest of the semester
you individually and your team separately willuse the feedback from these proposals to help define that final project idea
during each of theseproposal phases, you will give feedback to your classmates to help refine the ideas and potentially findteammates with similar interests

“didmore research on such and such” is not an accomplishment, it is an activity (and a looselydefined one)
● team’s goals for the following week both team and individual weekly reports are due at 11:59 pm on the monday of each week starting onweek 4
the team leader will be responsible for submitting team reports and leading the discussion during the weekly meeting
one of the team members, acting as a scribe , will be responsiblefor generating the meeting minutes throughout the semester
each team member isexpected to identify 10 relevant papers for their project and specify how they should be referenced intheir final report
these papers will be different for each team member (so that a team of 4 will have 40papers to reference in their final report)
of these papers, each person will read two of these papers thatare especially relevant in depth and write a reading summary on those two papers
6
poster design and presentation (10%) poster design & updates (5%), cdr midterm presentation (2%), external posterpresentations (3%)this grading criteria evaluate your team’s project progress in terms of its critical design in the mid-pointof the semester
your midterm presentation will serve as a critical design review for your project
yourteam will demonstrate this progress through a poster design and corresponding in-class discussion ofyour poster
your poster will receive feedback from your instructors and peers that you must address inorder to receive credit
