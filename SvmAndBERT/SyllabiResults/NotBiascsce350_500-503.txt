course prerequisites ecen 248 - introduction to digital systems required book david patterson and john hennessy , “computer organization and design: the hardware/software interface”, arm edition , 2016 or newer 
electronic versions are ok
(note: it must be the "arm" edition, no other edition is usable for this class ) course learning outcomes the goal of this course is to provide the student with a working knowledge of different methods for logic representation, manipulation, and optimization, for both combinational and sequential logic
individual course objectives: at the end of this course, students should: understand the organization of a computer system including the cpu datapath, cpu control, and memory systems understand the impact of semiconductor technology on computer design and architecture
understand the basics and principles of instruction set design
understand the impact of instruction sets on hardware design
be familiar with designing datapaths for a processor 
understand the implications of branch instructions on program flow and hardware design
understand the role of compilers and high-level languages in programming
understand the dif ferences in single-cycle/multicycle design of processors
understand basics of memory technology , registers, sram, dram
understand the memory architectures including cache architectures
be familiar with various cache architectures: direct-mapped, set-associative, wide/narrow block size etc
be familiar with the need for address translation
understand the impact of address translation on cache/memory accesses
be familiar with hardware designs of various cache architectures
understand the basics of input/output
understand the principles of thread-level parallelisms and processor microarchitecture which exploit it
i will not curve the individual exams and assignments
attendance: students are expected to attend and be active discussion participants during the lectures (answering questions posed, asking questions, commenting etc.)
exams: there will be two exams
tentative t est schedule: exam 1 – march 04, 2022 exam 2 – may-09-2022 assignments/quizzes: rather than traditional homework, this course will rely upon a series of on-line quiz assessments
the goal of these quizzes will be to test your knowledge of the lecture material and pinpoint which lectures you should go back and review on-line
there will be one quiz for each lecture, this quiz must be completed prior to the next lecture
students may retake the quiz as many times as desired between its release and the next lecture
the t amu canvas system will be used for all quiz submissions
labs: the course will have nine prelabs and nine labs (tentative)
late post-labs will have 20% of the points deducted for being late up to 1-week
lectures: lectures will be in person in the classroom
