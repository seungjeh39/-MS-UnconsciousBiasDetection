7
test coverage)
you are expected to submit your test results
** if you intend to publish your results, you will need to complete an irb 8
report progress (18%) individ ual proposal ( 1%) scenario 1: for students who participate in an externally sponsored project, you will describe your approach to the given problem statement in the individual proposal, get your proposal reviewed, and give a review on your classmates’ individual proposals
when the team is formed, all individual proposals are synthesized and become part of the final report
scenario 2: the second alternative is to iterate through potential project ideas which have a proven need / existing beneficiary 
reviews from your classmates on your proposals will help define the final project idea
likewise, you will review your classmates’ work to help refine their ideas and potentially find teammates with similar interests
abstract (1%) this is a summary of your final report that describes: your problem (with attention grabber), how you plan on solving it, and expected outcome
these papers will be different for each team member ( e.g.
a team of 4 will have 20 papers to reference in their final report)
related work refers to each person read ing two papers and writ ing a reading summary on those two papers
introduction (1%) the introduction provide s a brief overview of the project and helps the reader put into context the design and implementation
engineering standard (1%) engineering standards are factors that are related to your project and may bound or constrain your project
requirements (2%) the design part of your methodology should clearly describe what your solution seeks to achieve, what the user experience will be, what tools you will use, and what challenges you will face
senior capstone – csce 482 course syllabus page 7 of 13 prototype (1%) prototyping allows you to test the quality of your design before you start coding, makes sure that that all team members know and agree on the final product
evaluation (3%) the evaluation section describes procedures that you wi ll use to test that your system does what it was designed to do
implementation, results, discussion ( 3%) the implementation part of your methodology describes your system in detail including individual components, tools used, your system hierarchy, and any other details for the audience to understand how your system works
the results section will summarize the outcome of your project with respect to what metrics you collected and your evaluation to show whether or not you achieved your d efinition of success
the discussion section includes a reflection on the results
final report increment -including p reviously submitted sections of final report ( 1%) this allows you to submit updates to final report sections previously submitted
9
your final report will be critiqued on its thorough ness and effectiveness in communicating key aspects of your system 
github documentation and code will be critiqued on its completeness to properly execute and understand the details of your system
the demo video is a 2 -minute video which future generation of students can view as they also embark on their capstone journey
all final deliverables must be submitted in order to receive a grade for the class 
code (with corresponding documentation) will be submitted in the class github repository , while no n-code will be submitted in a ms team drive repository organize d into folder

borrowed / purchased items (e.g.
keys, books, equipment) have been returned to their proper location or to their owner 
purchases and reimbursements ● accurate forms: please ensure that purchase order (po) forms submitted to the department are accurate
submitting a po with incomplete specifications or bac kordered items increases the workload for our accounting staff and causes unnecessary delays to your team
● in-stock items: please verify that items are in stock before submitting a po, and provide alternative vendors if an item is likely to go out of stock (e.g.
to minimize overhead on our accounting staff, we will only reimburse up to five purchase orders (of your choice); this policy also encourages teams to plan their purchases in advance
reimbursement of sales taxes is not allowed by the university; please make sure to bring tax- exempt forms with you whenever you make local purchases (or purchases within the state)
