in addition to accommodations, i can help you develop strategies to become successful in this course
prior to being a professor, i worked as a certified sign language interpreter in the state of texas while getting my ms and phd degrees in computer science
i have a great interest in providing an environment where students with disabilities can thrive
i wish i could accommodate anyone for any need
i’m always fascinated with the rich tapestry of diversity which make up my classes
“i’d prefer that you get your accommodations and not need them, rather than trying without your accommodations and finding out that you neede d them.
earlier in my career i noticed a disturbing pattern
student s would try to get through the first exam without using their accommodations
i suspect this was due to negative experiences with prior instructors
frequently, they said they just wanted to try it without the accommodation
after the first exam, there would be a rush of students submitting their accommodation letters
these instances have greatly decreased since i’ve been explicit about my preferences
for that reason, i try to design all of my course material to be inclusive and accessible
i rely in part on my students to let me know when and where they need some accommodation
i want you to know that my top priority is for my students to learn as much as they can in my class
that includes working with students to find solutions that help them perform at their best
i hope tools like the disability accommodation portal will make it easier for students to start the conversation about how we can work together to help them make the most out of their learning opportunities
paul taele's accessibility statement your experience in this class is important to me
it is the policy and practice of texas a&m university to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law
) so we can discuss how they will be implemented in this course
disability 4 of 13 resources facilitates the interactive process that establishes reasonable accommodations
click here for disability resources's website.link
part of this includes support for students with disabilities
in addition to being required by campus policy, i have personally worked with students whose utilization of the resources available to them has helped them achieve greater success in their completion of the course
please activate your accommodations in the new disability accommodation portal (aim portal) 
i would also be happy to meet with any student and discuss their accommodations if you prefer that as well
class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name
i will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun
please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that i may make appropriate changes to my records
