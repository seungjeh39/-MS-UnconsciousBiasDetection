course syllabus page 2 of 7 grading policy • participation 2% • homework assignments 25% • algorithm history/application essay 3% • midterm 1 23% • midterm 2 23% • final exam 24% the grading scale will be: a ≥ 91% > b ≥ 81% > c ≥ 71% > d ≥ 61% > f
if the course average is slow, a slight upward curve may be applied
participation grade can be met by in-class participation (e.g.
answering questions, presenting answers to in-class activities, answering polling questions), and out-of-class engagement (e.g.
if it is submitted within 5 hours of the deadline, it will be graded with a smaller penalty of 5% x (number of hours since deadline)
work submitted more than 24 hours after the deadline will not be accepted
if a student needs to be absent from class on a test day due to an unavoidable and acceptable excused absence, that student needs to get approval from the instructor in advance
if any tests are missed, the final grade will be computed using the weighted average of remaining assignments in the course (which includes other tests, homework assignments, and quizzes)
homework policy although it is not required, you are encouraged to work on and complete all homework assignments on your own without consulting peers or outside sources
