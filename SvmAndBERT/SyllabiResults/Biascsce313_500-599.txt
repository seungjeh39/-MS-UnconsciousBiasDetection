although some amount of buffer planning has been buil t-in to the schedule, we will respond to situation ‘on the ground’ and respond as dictated by the over -arching goal of maximizing learning and assimilation
more specifically, by the end of this course we should be fairly good at making full use of the services provided by the underlying operating system by programming directly at the operating system interface level

given the university requirements for the prescribed format of this course, the labs will not be conducted over zoom so if you are unable to be in college station physically, you may need to defer this course to a later semester

teaching staff support it is important to lay out broad expectations for support as follows based on the roles: your instructor will be on hand to answer queries on lectures and practice questions, offer mentoring, and conduct quiz/exam review sessions/support
their time is best spent on providing clarifications on assignments and offer detailed feedback on coding quality and organization

bettati and ahmed for making their entire course content available for use in this semester offering, especially because the instructor is returning to teach this course after a nearly 4+year hiatus
during spring 2016, a small number of enterprising undergraduate students took the daunting task of working with the instructor and (then ta) prof
ahmed in his fall 2016 csce -313 course and resulting student feedback was rolled in to the spring 2017 offering, and improved ever since
the lion’s share of contributions was made by andrew kirfman an d joshua higginbotham, both former csce undergraduate students
and finally, a note for the sake of ou r health and well -being: to help protect aggieland and stop the spread of covid -19, texas a&m university urges students to be vaccinated and to wear masks in classrooms and all other academic facilities on campus, including labs
covid -19 vaccines and masking — regardless of vaccination status — have been shown to be safe and effective at reducing spread to others, infection, hospitalization, and death
