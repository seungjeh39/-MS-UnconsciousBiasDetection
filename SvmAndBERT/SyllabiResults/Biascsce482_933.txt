___________________________________________________________________________ catalog description engineering design; working as a design-team member, conceptual design methodology, design evaluations, total project planning and management techniques, design optimization, systems manufacturing costs considerations; emphasis placed upon student's activities as design professionals
course prerequisites (csce 315 or csce 331) and two additional csce tracked courses and, senior classification textbook and references required ● the five dysfunctions of a team: a leadership fable by patrick m
lencioni (jossey-bass, 2002) recommended ● design for electrical and computer engineers , by ralph ford and chris coulston (mcgraw-hill science, 2007)
● fundamentals of engineering design , 2 nd ed.
smith, collins (2003)
available on-line at tamu libraries
supplemental ● technical material from the literature, manufacturer’s data sheets and user manuals
the focus is not only on the final product but also on design methodology, management process and teamwork
however, every member of the group is expected to participate 
expected outcomes it is expected that successful participation in the course will allow the student to demonstrate: ● analyze a complex computing problem and to apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions
● communicate ef fectively in a variety of professional contexts
● recognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgments in computing practice based on legal and ethical principles
● function ef fectively as a member or leader of a team engaged in activities appropriate to the program’ s discipline
thus, both continued progress (the process) and the quality of your product (and other deliverables) will determine your grade
although the bulk of your grade is based on the performance of your team, individual performance will also be gauged
project proposal (5%) : these points will be based on (1) the originality, creativity and feasibility of the proposed work, the analysis of alternative solutions, the consideration of economic and societal aspects, the project management approach (3%), and (2) the quality of the oral presentation (2%)
2
final communication (15%): this grade will be based on the quality of the final presentation (5%), as well as the contents and professional finish of the documentation (10%)
4
the weekly report should be incremental , and should specifically address the following: a
any major accomplishments during this time period , including figures and results c
an overview of the plan of work for the following two weeks d
for items 1-5: using github sites for your group and grading purposes: i
all required group materials such as project proposal, weekly report, cdr, final report and presentation files, should be shared on the tamu github
ii
teams should make use of github features such as the readme, issues, wiki, etc, in order to provide documentation for their project
teamwork (10%): it is very important to understand that accomplishing the technical objectives of the project is not sufficient
thus, a grade will be assigned based on the ability of the group to function as a team
2% is given to the teamwork quiz and ii
8% is determined by final evaluation of teamwork effectiveness
teamwork grade level cannot be higher than project grade
entries in the notebook should be made during or shortly after every work session
each entry should include (1) the date, (2) the objectives for that session, and (3) record of what was done
ii
you can choose either paper-based notebook or electronic-based notebook: paper-based notebooks must have permanent binding (i.e.
composition pads); spiral-bound notebooks will not be accepted, failing to do so will result in a 5% penalty on the final grade
the file should clearly contain aforementioned materials in an organized manner
the file should be cumulative which contains all the information since the beginning of the class
team leaders will instead be evaluated by their ability to make the group operate as a team, i.e.
c
d
all project code should be managed, from the project beginning, in this system
for example, if you only commit code at the last week of semester, you will lose the three points
note: code quality including metrics such as structure, readability, and efficiency will be weighted more heavily than the number of lines of code committed
iii
(4%) adherence to good version control practices such as using branches to develop new features without affecting the main branch, avoiding bundling unrelated changes into single commits, and writing good commit messages
all team members are required to be present at the time of the final delivery unless due to excused absence allowed by student rule 7
it should include a plain text readme file that documents the list of contents
2) software install, to be demonstrated on several machines 3) peer reviews 4) notebooks (scanned copy) final reports should have a discussion of constraints that the team had to satisfy (e.g.
cost, time, technology limitations) and of relevant industry standards used (e.g.
document preparation all major documents (proposal, cdr, and final documentation) should be submitted in a professional format (e.g.
spiral-binding), and should contain a title page, an outline, as well as clear section and subsection headings, etc
