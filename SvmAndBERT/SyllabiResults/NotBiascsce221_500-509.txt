required: a computer with a web camera
a computer that you need to use during the labs and lectures totake in-class quizzes and tests.
required: web, zoom, and canvas access
the course material, assignments turn-in, and posting gradesare handled through canvas
your ﬁnal grade will be determined based on written homework, programming assignments, cultural assignment,quizzes, and exams.
the assignment handout will provide points distribution
each programming assignment will be graded focusedon: algorithm design, usage of data structures and/or new user-deﬁned types and their implementation, itscorrectness, tests, a typed report describing implemented algorithms and data structures, and results ofcomputational experiments.
attendance• the students lab attendance is required and will be taken on regular basis.
the lecture attendance will be taken by pop quizzes
the students are responsible to learn all material coveredin class, read the assigned text from the textbook and do homework assignments.
the 2 bonus points will be added to your ﬁnal score if you have a perfect lab attendance, or 1 point if you haveonly one lab absence.
explainspolicies and excused absences
please discuss unusual circumstances in advance with the instructor.note
2 of 812/29/21, 6:37 pm • all homework assignments will be announced in class and posted on canvas
see the link to the coursecalendar on canvas for deadlines.
culture assignments allow you to explore the latest developments in computer science and engineering orlearn about the famous computer scientists like turing award winners
quizzes are over material covered during the lectures and assigned reading from the textbook.
work policya late homework assignment will be accepted up to 1 day with a 5% penalty
once solutions have been discussedor handed out the assignments will not be accepted

additional course informationlearning resources• you may have noticed from the syllabus that this course focuses on obtaining a computer science backgroundand developing programming skills
programming is not something you can learn overnight by reading atextbook or lecture notes; it requires a lot of practice
5 of 812/29/21, 6:37 pm understand the course material, and help you to master your programming skills so please see us during ourofﬁce hours
a few hints about how to succeed in this course:◦ attend class and lab meetings regularly◦ read lecture notes and related material in the textbook, and feel free to ask questions◦ study for quizzes and tests◦ retype and implement in c++ examples from the lecture notes and textbook◦ complete all labs and projects◦ if you have any course related questions please visit us during our ofﬁce hours◦ use the online campuswire to ask questions and participate in discussionsin general, computer science is not an easy subject but it will pay off after graduation
