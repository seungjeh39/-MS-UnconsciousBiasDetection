 office hours: friday 2:00 pm - 4:00 pm or appointment by email course description specification, analysis and implemen tation of abstract data types for lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables, graphs, and their associated algorithms
design and implement diverse data structures that allow easy access and manipulation of data using c++ programming language
2
use the dat a structures to implement algorithms
3
apply the big -o asymptotic notation to analyse and select an efficient algorithm for solving a given problem with respect to runtime and memory usage

 slides used in the class/lectures
 there will be o 4 assignments, each building upon the previous one
the 4 assignments together will make one course project
o labs every week, managed by the ta(s) – coding questions to solve in 50 minutes
o there will be two exams, a midterm and a final, both conceptual, multi -choice
o a quiz every week (1 hour, 10 points), based on the materials covered in the week
o peer reviews of the pseudocode/algo rithm question of assignments
 4 assignments – 35%; 15% labs; 10% peer reviews; 25% - exams (10% midterm and 15% final); 15% quizzes
the next question will be about writing the corresponding code (50%), and an analysis of the time complexity of an algorithm (20%)
o you are not allowed to copy their solutions
there will be at least one name always there – of the student you did the peer review with
if there are other students with whom you discuss the logic, mention them
note: your code will be chec ked for plagiarism against your peers and github repos we can locate that have similar codes on them
o the pseudocode aspect of the assignment will be submitted and peer reviewed one week from the doling out of the assignment
the submission date will be mentioned in the assignment
changes can be made to the pseudocode based on peer reviews (if deemed appropriate by the student themselves) for final submission
not doing so will lead to a 5% deduction from the coding section of the assignment
 labs – a coding assignment in the lab directed by the ta
if you collaborate with anyone (both in and out of the lab), mention it in the comments above the submitted code
all labs carry equal weightage
 quiz – a weekly quiz to evaluate the understanding of the concepts, code and complexity analysis of the algorithms or data structures taught in the week
 midterm/final – questions testing the understanding of concepts
all multi -choice
one-third of the final will be based on material covered before midterm
 peer review – students will be reviewing each other’s pseudocode for each assignment (groups of 2, different for each assignment)
an advice is to consult each other about the review that the students submit
sound, good faith critiquing (even if incorrect) will receive full grade
class participation – peer -review and allowing discussions over the assignments and labs will test your interaction skills in the course
peer -review will substitute for your class participation
you can submit assignments late, but all the late days for each assignment will be tallied at the end of the semester
this is to keep you motivated and not give up mid -way through the semester if you fall behind in any assignment, giving you room to make up for the lost time
 late day penalty: we will deduct 1.2
that means, if the cumulative total of all assignments was 450/500 (90%), for example, with a total of 10 late days, 12.
to understand the circumstances under which makeup wo rk or excused absences are allowed, please read student rule 7 
course schedule google drive link is shared with the class
course information items technology support – we will be using:  canvas - for quizzes and uploading of assignments documents  github - push your submissions to your private repositories  piazza - join the piazza course page for discussions regarding anything pertaining to the class
