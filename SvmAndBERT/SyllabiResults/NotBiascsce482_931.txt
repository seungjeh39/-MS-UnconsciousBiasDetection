 office hours: by appointment course description engineering design; working as a design -team member, conceptual design methodology, design evaluations, total project planning and management techniques, design optimization, systems manufacturing costs considerations; emphasis placed upon student's activities as design professionals
csce 482(the capstone design program) consists of the design and implementation of a system (capstone design project) based on the knowledge and skills acquired in earlier course work with significant computer software
csce 482 is a project -oriented course aimed at developing system integration skills
students work in groups of 4 -5 people to complete a significant engineering design project
every pro ject requires complete implementation, documentation and demonstration of a software system, which may also involve minor hardware too
each team is required to manage its own efforts to complete its project in a timely manner
group members are required to keep individual lab notebooks recording their efforts and their personal impressions of the project
since the projects will be student managed, the exact nature and style of these meetings is at the group’s discretion
at the end of the semester, each group will make a public presentation describing and demonstrating their work
these presentations are open to the university community

1
project proposal (10%) : these points will be based on the originality, quality and feasibility of the proposed work, the analysis of alternative solutions, the consideration of economic and societal aspects, and the project management approach, as reflected on your written proposal (75%) and oral presentation (25%)
2
weekly progress (10%) : this grade will be based on your team’s ability to maintain the project on schedule
agenda for the weekly meeting with the instructor and the ta 2
team’s accomplishments during this period
“did more research on such and such” is not an accomplishment, it is an activity (and a loosely defined one)
3
team’s goals for the following week (individual tasks are entered on basecamp) 4
minutes from t he previous meeting weekly progress reports are due at 8am on the day of the weekly meeting
the team leader will be responsible for submit ting these reports and leading the discussion during the weekly meeting
one of the team members, acting as a scribe, will be responsible for generating the meeting minutes throughout the semester
3
critical design review (10%) : the cdr is a mid -semester ev aluation of your project
a template for the cdr report and a p resentation rubric are available on the course webpage
4
project grade (20%) : a final grade will be assigned to your project based on the completion of all the objectives stated in the proposal, as well as on a live demonstration in front of the class
the complexity of your project and the size of your team will be factored in
due date: project demonstrations will take place the last day of class of the week prior to final presentations
this earlier deadline ensures that teams have time to (i) thoroughly test and validate their systems a fter the demo, and (ii) prepare the final presentation
6
team work (10%) : it is very important to understand that accomplishing the technical objectives of the project is not sufficient
being physically present in the same room encourages collaboration and equal distribution of workload
individual performance (30%) : points in this category are awarded based on assessments of your personal contribution to the team efforts: a
notebook (10%): you are required to maintain an individual design notebook to collect any information relevant for the project, including ideas, references, designs, and discussions
your notebook will be graded based on: 1
sketches, block diagrams, schematics, pseudo -code, experimental results, formal d erivations), 2
the organization of your notebook b
participation (10%): the instructor and tas will evaluate your attendance to meetings, participation in the discussions, and contributions to the team
c
peer review (10%): your performance will be evaluated by each of your team membe rs throughout the semester
late submissions will not be accepted
note: grades will not be assigned until all project deliverables have been turned in (see below), all borrow ed items (e.g.
keys, books, equipment) have been returned to their proper location or their owner, and the workstations in the lab have been thoroughly cleaned up
final del iverables • usb drive including the following (please organize into folders, e.g.
docs, source, hardware, media, references, freeware, etc.
o designs: code, schematics, data, da ta sheets, freeware software tools, etc
please use the templates available in the course website
please run a spell check before submitting
they can provide assistance on the written reports that are due throughout the class (proposal, cdr, final report)
