 csce 111: introduction to computer science , spring 2022 department of computer science and engineering, texas a&m university © 2016 –2022 robert lightfoot page 1 of 12 csce 111 introduction to programming concepts course syllabus wait a minute what are all of these non -computer science majors doing taking this class? i am about to reach over 1 500 students this semester in this class
why are students taking this and why are other majors requiring it? the use of computers in every industry makes this a very good reason
required for all students? throughout many college careers, there are classes that are required for every major
computer science classes can help with that
why do i teach this there are a lot of reasons this is a class i chose to teach:  i think it is fun to see a machine do exactly what i command
 i think it is more fun to see students realize this is very doable
 i enjoy the challenge and the reward of your success 
 i have had a fantastic career developing software
 i think there is so much more to come, i want to help others get ready
 java is a fun language to teach
csce 111: introduction to computer science , spring 2022 department of computer science and engineering, texas a&m university © 2016 –2022 robert lightfoot page 2 of 12  use java to produce software
 understand programming in other settings, like excel or javascript 
 feel comfortable changing their major to computer science
course overview the computer’s role in culture has expanded from a calculating machine used by governments to the ipod as a fashion accessory, the smart phone as a compani on, and the internet as a medium of self -expression
we inhabit a century where every job will be technical
from “if” conditionals t o “for” loops, knowing the basics of programming allows you to understand the way the modern world works
programming instruction teaches procedural and functional thinking, project management and time management, skills that are essential components of an empowered individual
programming is the power to create, the power to change, and the power to influence
programming teaches logic, algorithmic t hinking, and an iterative approach to solving problems and testing your ideas
these skills make you smarter and are useful no matter what you do
learning to program can be incredibly rewarding, give you a new appreciation for technology, and introduce co untless career opportunities
catalog description using computation to enhance problem -solving abilities; understanding how people communicate with computers, and how computing affects society; computational thinking; software design principles, including algorithm design, data representation, abstraction, modularity, structured and object -oriented programming, documentation, testing, portability, and maintenance; understanding programs’ abilities and limitations; development and execution of programs
week ly topics some of the topics to be covered in lecture periods are:  formal and natural languages
csce 111: introduction to computer science , spring 2022 department of computer science and engineering, texas a&m university © 2016 –2022 robert lightfoot page 3 of 12  variables, assignment, printing, mental models for computers
 conditionals, if statements
 looping, while do loops, do while loops, flow charts
 use a java compiler to produce executable software
 understand the concepts of java classes and objects
 understand the concepts of lifet ime, scope, and the initialization mechanism of variables
 implement java code branching using if or switch statements
 program loops with while, for, and do statements
 make use of arrays to store and process lists of data
 assemble data and methods into classes following the software engineering principles of encapsulation and data hiding
 organize java code following the software engineering principles of modularity and abstraction
 test and evaluate introductory java programs
class meetings: this course re quires you to have a computer
this complies with the college of engineering’s bring your own device (byod) policy 
you will find their office hours in canvas
grading grading will come from the accumulation of points throughout the semester
there are a total of 1500 point s available to earn
unlike the traditional 90% or 1350 points , you can choose from different assignments with different values to get your points
csce 111: introduction to computer science , spring 2022 department of computer science and engineering, texas a&m university © 2016 –2022 robert lightfoot page 5 of 12 the main requirements will provide enough points to get a c in the course
this is the minimum needed to pass
by choosing other assignments or additional pathways , you can build your grade to the grade you want
zybooks : (core) weekly zybooks assignmen ts account for 100 points 
each week will have a reading to do before class and examples and challenge activities to do by the end of the week
lab: (core) lab works, activities, and/or demos count for 100 points of your grade
assignments: (core) weekly coding assignments account for 500 points of your grade
more complicated assignments towards the end of the semester are weighted heavier than earlier ones
projects: (core) projects account for 200 points of your grade
there will be two projects with each project having multiple deliverables
projects are team -based
additional pathways to build your personal learning experience: 7 of the 11 categories are additional pathways that you can pick
many of these are a great way to build a solid base of points that will get you the grade you want
engagement and participation: engagement counts for 100 points 
historically in my classes, those students who get full credit for engagement make the highest grades
each week you will have several opportunities to show your engagement 
this is one of the best ways to earn points
most engagement points will be earned while in class
there will be more than 100 points of opportunity to account for csce 111: introduction to computer science , spring 2022 department of computer science and engineering, texas a&m university © 2016 –2022 robert lightfoot page 6 of 12 some missed chances
this path follows along each week of the semester
there is no way to make up engagement
topics will be given every week
you will provide your thoughts on the discussion and reflect on 2 other students work
these are online discussions in canvas that happen once p er week for the whole semester
there will be coding challenges available for you to be able to do
information will be posted when the challenge is available
coding challenges is a 5 week “scenic tour” of things we have learned
social media scavenger hunt a scavenger hunt will be worth 50 points
information will be posted when the challenge is available
the scavenger hunt is a small rest stop on your path that will be available early in the semester
details will be provided
if you would like to try this, it can add to your points
this is another small rest stop on your path that will be available once you have lear ned enough in the class to be successful
youtube channel a youtube channel option worth 100 points will be available as one of your assignments
details will be provided
if you would like to try this, it can add to your points
the youtube option is another scenic side road that will help you show your mastery in this class
final test (optional) a final test will be worth 100 points
if you usually do well at test s, this will be a chance to take one
information will be posted when the test is available, how csce 111: introduction to computer science , spring 2022 department of computer science and engineering, texas a&m university © 2016 –2022 robert lightfoot page 7 of 12 you will take it, and what it will cover
this is a great way to make up for some things that might not have gone as planned
it only adds to your grade and cannot reduce it
extensions on due dates are required for any excused absences
you may ask for these in class
