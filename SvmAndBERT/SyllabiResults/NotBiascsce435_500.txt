descriptionthis course provides an overview of parallel computing technology and programming methods.th
topics in the course include: multiprocessor architectures, programming tools, parallelperformance, parallel algorithms, and applications of parallel computing.cours
learning outcomesthe main objective of this course is to provide an opportunity for our undergraduate students tolearn about parallel computing technology and to develop programming skills on traditional andemerging platforms for parallel computation
upon successful completion of the course, a student:• will be able to design parallel algorithms and develop software implementations on parallelcomputers;• will be able to analyze the performance of parallel implementations on various parallelplatforms; and• will know the architecture of modern parallel computing systems.textboo
