detailed course description cpsc 48 2 & 483 are project -oriented course s aimed at developing system integration skills
students work in groups of 3-5 people to complete a significant engineering design project
every project requires complete implementation, documentation and demonstration of a computing system design with both hardware and software components
the focus is not only on the final product but also on design methodology, management process and teamwork
each team will be required to manage its own efforts to complete its proje ct in a timely manner
these meetings must be attended by every group member
since the projects will be student managed , the exact nature and style of these meetings is at the group’s discretion
at the end of the semester, each group will make a public presentation describing and demonstrating their work
the se presentations will be open to the university community
course objectives to prepare students for engineering practice with a major design experience based on the knowledge and skills acquired in earlier course work and incorporating en gineering standards and realistic constraints that include most of the following considerations: economic; environmental; sustainability; manufacturability; ethical; health and safety; social; and political
expected outcomes it is expected that successful participation in the course will allow the student to demonstrate: • analyze a complex computing problem and to apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions
• design, implement, and evaluate a com puting -based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program’s discipline
• communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts
1
apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing -based solutions
although the bulk of your grade is based on the performance of your team, individual performance will also be gauged
a template for the proposal report and a presentation rubric are available on the course webpage
3 critical design review (10%) : the cdr is a mid -semester evaluation of your project
a template for the cdr report and a presentation rubric are available on the course webpage 
4 final communication (15%): this grade will be based on the quality of the final presentation (5%), as well as the contents and professional finish of the documentation (10%)
a template for the final report and a presentation rubric are available on the course webpage
2 weekly p rogress (10%): this grade will be based on your team’s ability to maintain the project on schedule
an overview of the plan of work for the following two weeks d
minutes of the previous meeting weekly progress reports are due two hours prior to the time of the weekly meeting
the responsibility of preparing these reports will be rotated among team members
the team member preparing the report will also be in char ge of facilitating the discussions during that weekly meeting, and preparing an action list for the following week
the action list contains the set of specific goals that each team member gas agreed to complete and a deadline for completing them
5 project grade (20%): a final grade will be assigned to your project based on the completion of all the objectives stated in the proposal, as well as on a live demonstration in front of the class
the complexity of your project and the size of your team w ill be factored in
due date: project demonstrations will take place 48 hours prior to the final presentation (or the friday prior if on a weekend)
for items 1 -5: using github sites for your group and grading purposes: i.team
will use the tamu enterprise github to organize and trace course progress and materials
also, the activity log of the github will be used to access how each iv.individua
and wiki in order to provide documentation for their project
teamwork score is no more than the project grade in 5
2% is given to the teamwork quiz and ii
7 individua l performance (30%): points in this category are awarded based on assessments of your personal contribution to the team efforts: a
notebook ( 5%): you are required to record what you do as a member of the project
a grade will be assigned to your personal design notebook based on: i
the regularity of your entries throughout the semester
ii
iii
the clarity, legibility and organization of your annotations
electronic notebook can be either word file or pdf file
the file should clearly co ntain aforementioned materials in an organized manner
participation ( 4%): the instructor and ta will evaluate your attendance to meetings, participation in the discussions, and contributions to the team
item (6) above
peer review ( 9%): your performance will be evaluated by each of your team members throughout the semester
there are three peer reviews throughout the semester
d
github insights (10%): all projects will be hosted on tamu’s enterprise github (github.
through proper version control techniques, your individual work history on the project will be documented
you will be required to maintain a stable master project b ranch by implementing features on separate working branches and creating pull requests for the entire team to review and merge into the master branch
you will be assigned a grade for your github contributions based on: i
(3%) the regularity of your commit history throughout the semester
ii
(4%) the quality and quantity of code and documentation you committed to the project throughout the semester
iii
online course about ethics (2%) : we will provide an online ethics cours e in canvass
f
autodrive challenge participation extra credit (max 5%): all projects this semester are facilitated through the texas a&m unmanned team as part of the gm/sae autodrive challenge
throughout the semester, there may be opportunities to contribute to the team beyond what is required as part of the course requirements e.g
note : grades will not be assigned until all project deliverables have been turned in (see below), all borrowed items (e.g.
keys, books, equipment) have been returned to their proper location or their owner, and the workstations in the lab have been thoroughly cleaned up
final deliverables 1) final documentation and project materials in electronic zip file with name as team_name_ project_report.zi
docs, sour ce, hardware, media, references, freeware , videos ) a) designs: code, schematics, data, data sheets, freeware software tools, etc
b) reports: proposal, cdr, weekly reports, final report, and all presentations c) audiovisual media: close -up pictures of your system *and* a high-quality movie demo of the system working, for posterity 
3) final hardware prototype, as well as any spare parts and supplies 4) software install, to be demonstrated on several machines 5) peer reviews 6) notebooks final reports should have a discussion of constraints that the team had to satisf y (e.g.

this is our intended schedule, but we may modify it during the semester to accommodate necessary changes
