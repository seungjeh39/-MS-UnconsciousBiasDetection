 every computer scientist and computer engineer who wants to work on big problems musthave these skills
after this course, you will be able to: ●analyzea complex computing problem andidentifysolutionsusing computing principles, ●design, implement, and evaluatea computing-basedsolution to meet a given set of requirements, ●applycomputer science theory and software developmentfundamentals toproducecomputing-based solutions, ●collaborateeffectively as a member of a team, ●recognizeprofessional responsibilities, both legaland ethical, andmake informed judgementsincomputing practice, and ●communicateeffectively
the ta and i are always especially excited to teachthis course, and here is why: ●you finally get to combine everything that you have learned throughout your entireundergraduate curriculum.thi
not only includes thecomputer science skills you have gained,but also the professional, cultural, and communication skills that you have developed
we actively promote diversity and inclusion within our field notlimited to race, ethnicity, religion, disability, age, sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation
thus, we areunited in our condemnation of racism and any form of injustice
as martin luther king jr
if any student wishes to discuss anything regardinginclusivity within the classroom, especially anything contrary to this statement that you haveexperienced, you are encouraged to contact the ta or instructor
these includerequirements to participate actively in class, complete assignments in a timely manner, keep the videoon with your face visible in virtual meetings, and treat your classmates and instructors with respect
each team is required to accommodate the following: ●time management:manage its own efforts to completeits project in a timely manner
you aregraded based on both the quality of the group product and their individual contributions
these meetings must be attended by every group member
every member of the group is expected to participate in these meetings .a
while most materials andassignments will be handled online, the class itself will be held in-person and synchronously, whichmeans you are required to be present and active during all classes and all class times
attendance policystudents required to quarantine or self-isolate should still participate in courses and course-relatedactivities remotely and must not attend face-to-face course activities
students under quarantine orself-isolation are expected to participate in courses and complete graded work unless they havesymptoms that are too severe to participate in course activities
instructors teaching courses deliveredonly face-to-face should work closely with students who are in quarantine or self-isolation to ensure thestudent keeps up with the work
students experiencing personal injury or illness that is too severe for the student to attend class qualifyfor an excused absence (seestudent rule 7, section7.2.2)
to receive an excused absence, studentsmust comply with the documentation and notification guidelines outlined in student rule 7
indicates a medical confirmation note from the student’s medicalprovider is preferred, please be understanding as not all illnesses may require a visit to a physician,especially during this time
therefore, attendance, punctuality and active participation in the weekly meetingsare required
●video presence:if you are attending this class online,then you are required to have your videoshowing your face
just as it is not appropriate to attend a face-to-face class with a blanket overyour head, it is not appropriate to attend class with your video off
this class has a significant communication component, and facialexpressions are vital to communication
we understand that you may have a “bad hair day” orsome other reason that you will need to keep your video off, and those are completely fine
lateness or absencecan be excused if there is a valid reason
are valid reasons
●valid excuses:oversleeping, a term paper due, anexam to cram for, etc.
are not valid reasons.ultimately
the instructor reserves the right to determine what constitutes a “valid reason” on acase-by-case basis
page3of15 course s yllabus student expectations:you are expected to: ●always use your @tamu.ed
●use your canvas account (canvas.tamu.edu
●be an active problem solver, contributor, and discussant in lecture and lab
●be prepared and accountable for both lecture and lab by reading the assigned material ahead oftime and be able to answer simple questions over said material
●be held accountable for all assigned material that is, or is not, explicitly discussed in class
●attend class as a community expectation

the quality of education you receive makes a bigdifference in your career success
abet accreditation: ●verifies that your educational experience meets the global standardfor technical education inyour profession
●enhances your employment opportunities—multinationalcorporations require graduation froman accredited program
●supports your entry to a technical professionthroughlicensure, registration andcertification—all of which often require graduation from an abet-accredited program as aminimum qualification
●paves the way for you to work globally, because abetaccreditation is recognized worldwidethrough international agreements, and many other countries’ national accrediting systems arebased on the abet model
in order for the department of computer science & engineering to keep their accreditation, the studentsmust demonstrate their abilities in each of the above expected outcomes of this class
unless otherwise noted on the syllabus or class calendar, allassignments will be due before class on the due date

late assignments will receive a grade reduction of 10% per daylate with a maximum reduction of 30%
submitting anincomplete po will result in the team being prevented from submitting additional pos; and alladditional purchases will have to be made by team members themselves and will be reimbursedat the end of the semester
if you suspect that a critical item may become backordered, it may be better if youpurchase it directly since pos may take several days to go through
tominimize overhead on our accounting staff, we will only reimburse up to five purchase orders (ofyour choice); this policy also encourages teams to plan their purchases in advance
