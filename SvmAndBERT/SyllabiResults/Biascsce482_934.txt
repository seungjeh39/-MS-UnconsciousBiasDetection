abet accreditation provides assurance that a college or university program meets the quality standards of the profession for which that program prepares graduates
the quality of education you receive makes a big dif ference in your career success

5/15abet accreditation: verifies that your educational experience meets the global standard for technical education in your profession
enhances your employment opportunities —multinational corporations require graduation from an accredited program
supports your entry to a technical profession through licensure, registration and certification —all of which often require graduation from an abet -accredited program as a minimum qualification
paves the way for you to work globally , because abet accreditation is recognized worldwide through international agreements, and many other countries’ national accrediting systems are based on the abet model
in order for the department of computer science & engineering to keep their accreditation, the students must demonstrate their abilities in each of the above expected outcomes of this class
grading policy the final grade you will receive in the class will be based on points accumulated during the semester 
thus, both continued progress (the process) and the quality of your product (and other deliverables) will determine your grade
unless otherwise noted on the syllabus or class calendar , all assignments will be due before class on the due date
as a communication course, you must pass the communication components (both written and oral) with a c or better to earn a grade in the course
failure to pass the communication components with a c or better results in an f for the course
grading scale: grades will be assigned according to the following scale: a >= 90 > b >= 80 > c >= 70 > d >= 60 > f these grades represent varying degrees of achievement (see the university's grading system (https://registrar.tamu.edu/transcripts-grades/grades#0-gradingsystem
): a = excellent, b = good, c = satisfactory , d = passing, f = failing
we make every ef fort to provide you with the opportunity to earn an a

rather , we teach to mastery which means that we have clear expectations in terms of what you should complete and what knowledge you should have obtained by the end of the course to succeed and to earn an a

y ou are also expected to use t amu github for version control and commit to your team's repository weekly , if not daily 
testing - 15%: your project must be evaluated in accordance with industry standards, so you need to test the technical performance of your developed materials as your project goes on
y ou are expected to develop an automatic test bed for your project
y ou should also have appropriate unit testing, integration testing, and system testing throughout your code to verify functionality 
y ou will be assessed on how well you have prepared and conducted the evaluation of your system, both internally (through unit/integration/system testing) and externally (through user study)
note that completing this user study is part of the required final deliverables and it not optional, even if you prefer to abandon the points
t eam members should take turns taking meeting minutes, submitting team reports, and leading the weekly meeting discussion
y ou will be also assessed on your team's ability to keep to the project schedule
thus, this not only lets us know where your knowledge might be lacking so that we may be able to correct it within this class, but it also serves to teach you the knowledge that you need to have
you must complete all of your peer reviews to get an a in the course
more than five (5) unexcused absences will lead to an automatic failure for the course 
do not count toward absences provided they are approved by the instructor in advance, abide by the instructor ’s requirements for check-in during course time, abide by any activity reporting requirements by the instructor , and complete all assignments on-time relevant to that class time
