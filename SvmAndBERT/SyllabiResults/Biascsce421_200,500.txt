late policy: 1 point (out of 100 point total) deduction per hour (24/100 per day)
all submissions should be done as colab notebooks
as a separate file, submit the revision logs (turn of f "output", compare current pin with immediate previous pin)
attendance: 6% 1% deduction per unexcused absence (see t amu student rules for excusable absences)
per university rule, only one interview is excusable
y ou should schedule your interview to avoid 9/15/22, 3:44 pm syllabus for 22 spring csce 421 machine learning (sections 200/500) https://canvas.tamu.edu/courses/137553/assignments/syllabu
use a consistent style
do not use initials
late work policy late penalty: 1 point (out of 100) per hour 
late submissions will not be accepted 4 days after the deadline and/or after the solution has been posted
local course policy all work should be done individually and on your own 
examples of events that do not count as an emergency include the following: (1) merely visiting the doctor's of fice without an explicit note from the of fice requesting absence
note that this is not an exhaustive list
all make up exams, if given, will be dif ferent from the original exam
