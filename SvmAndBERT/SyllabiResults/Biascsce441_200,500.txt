course learning outcomes • understand the graphics pipeline and make use of a basic implementation of the pipeline in modern hardware (and graphics li braries) • apply coordinate transforms and affine transformations and understand the application of such transforms using a vertex shader • apply basic geometric computations involving points, lines, planes, and triangles related to spatial queries • develop basic data structures to represent a mesh, including applying transforms and necessary data for shading • implement basic rasterization methods (algorithm, stage in the graphics pipeline, and relationship to fragment shaders) • make use of hierarchical animation • create local shading models (phong, etc.
• apply basic texture mapping • implement basic ray tracing • be introduced to the application of more advanced computer graphics topics (including, rendering, animation, real time and visualization) • practice translating mathematics into c/c++ programs course syllabus page 2 of 5 january 28, 2022 textbook and/or resource materials there is required no textbook for this class, since there are many online resources available
addison -wesley we will be using campuswire [code 3617] for: • announcements • discussions /help we will be using canvas for: • assignment submission grading policy • 70%: 6 substantial programming assignments (11.66
% each) • 10% midterm exam • 20%: final exam • you must obtain at least 50% on the final exam to pass the course
• you may optionally skip the midterm and make the final be worth 30% of the course grade
• final course grades will be based on the following scale: a = [ 100, 90], b = (90, 80], c = (80, 70], d = (70, 60], f = (60, 0] late work policy all assignments must be submitted on tim e
– 10:00 a.m
