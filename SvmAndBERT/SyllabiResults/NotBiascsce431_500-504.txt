in reality, effective software engineering requires developing a computing -based solution that solves the customer’s problem
as problems become more challenging, solid design, follow through, and teamwork skills become nece ssary to developing a solution
you will work in a project group to complete a project, through an application of an engineering approach to computer software design and development
every project requires complete implementation, documentation and demon stration csce 431 – software engineering course syllabus page 3 of 15 of the solution
the focus is not only on the final product but also on design methodology, management process, and teamwork
at the end of the semester, each group will make a public presentation to the class describing and demonstrating their wo rk
this course offers students a unique experience to work with a real -world customer, including the following: ● it challenges you to think critically and creatively, even under tremendous ambiguity 
there is no one right way to solve the problem 
● you “learn by doing” all semester long
working on real problems with real people has its challenges, but is also very rewarding 
● working on teams can be messy , but it’s worth it
it is amazing what you can accomplish together, so much more than on your ow n
● every semester is different, every team is different, every solution is different 
there is always something new to learn and innovate
● meetings outside the class, with your project group and the teaching team (hereafter referred to as instructors), allow you to connect with your classmates and discover the effectiveness of constant communication
● build the computing- based solution and deploy to the cloud as a saas (software as a service) web application, resolving all high severity bugs (those with no workarounds) 
this class is a 3 -credit hour class and meets officially for a little over 4 hours per week (250 minutes)
for every one credit hour in which you enroll, you will spend approximately 2 -3 hours outside of class studying
total commitment for this class is approximately 8.5-11.

graded project csce 431 – software engineering course syllabus page 6 of 15 group project grade you will work in a project group to develop an application for a real customer , through an application of an engineering approach to application design , development, validation, documentation , and end-of-semester class demonstration of the solution
the focus is not only on the fina l product but also on the process, project management, and teamwork
to allow you to experience a real- world scenario, the class will mimic a software development company, with you playing the role of an employee assigned to a project team
you will fin d a real- world customer who has a non-technical problem and build an application to solve their needs
each project group is required to use the ruby on rails framework, but can determine the technology used for the front -end (e.g.
html, css, ajax, javascript), and the data repository (e.g.
the class will be divided into project groups of ~4 -5 students
project rubrics will be distributed to class once the project groups are formed
because your teammates' grades are so tightly c oupled with your own commitment to the class, many of the rules are put in place to protect you and your teammates
● project deliverables – more detail on the expectations of each one is described in the project rubric
readme, code comments)
documentation will be evaluated on its completeness to understand the details of and to properly execute your system
o assigned documents (e.g.
designs), submitted to canvas and ms teams , which are evaluated on its completeness (using given template s), and effectiveness in communicating key aspects of csce 431 – software engineering course syllabus page 7 of 15 your system o high- quality recording of the final presentation submitted to canvas and ms teams , evaluated on the clarity of communication and demonstration of your system 
these will be viewed by other students in the class, and will be used as the basis for their end -of-semester reflection
o final updated powerpoint slide deck, used in the final presentation, submitted to canvas & ms teams o final report - your final report will be critiqued on its th oroughness , completeness (using given template), and effectiveness in communicating key aspects of your system and specificity of your reflection
these audits are mandatory and will be recorded in ms teams
these deadlines are intentional to make sure we have enough time to complete our assessment
● final course grades will not be released until all the project deliverables are verified by the instructor
o excellent peer feedback o effective (polite and collaborative) communic ation with the instructor/teaching team 
• each team member is expected to commit to the github repository several times a week, if not daily
• you are expected to develop an automatic test bed for your project
• each member of your project team will score and give feedback on the performance of the o ther team members through periodic peer feedback forms throughout the semester
your peer feedback responses will be calculated along with the instructors’ peer feedback view scores and will be part of your individual project grade 
depending on your circumstance, you will forfeit this grade after 3 days
quizzes frequent quizzes will be given and will cover material from the homework, lectures, and any pre & post lecture work
