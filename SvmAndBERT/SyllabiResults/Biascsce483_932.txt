every project requ ires complete implementation, documentation and demonstration of a hardware/software system, which has to involve a hardware component
group members are required to keep individual lab notebooks recording their efforts and their personal impressions of the project
every team is required to schedule a weekly meeting with the course instructor and the tas, preferably csce 483 syllab us 2/9 during the official class or lab hours
these meetings must be attended by every group member 
since the projects will be student managed, the exact nature and style of these meetings is at the group’s discretion
however, every member of the group is expected to participate
course prerequisites senior classification; csce 315, csce 462, ecen 325, and senior classification
special course designation fulfills a writing/communication requirement for graduation
as a result, the aggregate score of the written reports must be a passing grade in order to get a grade in the course
course learning outcomes it is expected that successful participation in the course w ill allow the student to demonstrate: • an ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering (3.a
• an ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret data (3.b
• an ability to function on multi -disciplinary teams (3.d
• an ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems (3.e
• an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility (3.f
• an ability to communicate ef fectively (3.g
• an ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice (3.k
moreover, course -specific outcomes are 1
understand the basic of project management including: statements of work, work break -down structures, critical path identification, distribution of tasks, project tracking and status reporting; be able to generate status reports; 3
understand professional communication methods and techniques including formal reports and presentations; 4
to rigorous ly define design requirements for potential solutions
understand and incorporate engineering standards and multiple realistic constraints that include most of the following considerations: economic, environmental, sustainability, manufacturability, ethica l, health and safety, social and political
supplemental: technical material from the literature, manufacturer’s data sheets and user manuals
thus, both continued progress (th e process) and the quality of your product (and other deliverables) will determine your grade
a template for the proposal report and a presentation rubric are available on the course webpage
each team submits a weekly report, which should be incremental and should specifically address the following: 1
accomplishments need to be measurable, e.g
the cdr grade will be based on the qu ality of your design (75%) –as reflected on your oral/poster presentation and written report, and on the degree to which you have a complete design (25%)
4
final reports should have a discussion of constraints that the team had to satisfy (e.g.
cost, time, te chnology csce 483 syllab us 4/9 limitations) and of relevant industry standards used (e.g.
this earlier deadline ensures that teams have time to (i) thoroughly test and validate their systems after the demo, and (ii) prepare the final presentation
team work (10%) : it is ver y important to understand that accomplishing the technical objectives of the project is not sufficient
these accomplishments should not come at the expense of destroying relationships among team members
thus, a grade will be assigned based on the ability of the group to function as a team
is there evidence that the group engaged in team building activities? were contributions to the project evenly distributed? were members equally engaged in discussions during meetings? was there an effective divisio n of responsibilities? note: the work should be done primarily in the lab and as a group, regardless of whether you can perform your task assignments individually elsewhere
a regular work schedule should be included in the proposal, showing the times when the team will meet in the lab to work on the project (in addition to meeting times)
7
individual performance (30%) : points in this category are awa rded based on assessments of your personal contribution to the team efforts: 1
notebook (10%): you are required to maintain an individual design notebook to collect any information relevant for the project, including ideas, references, designs, and discussio ns
your notebook will be graded based on: 1
the evidence of engineering design (e.g.
the regularity of your entries during the semester, and 3
each student is also required to pass a teamwork quiz with a score of 75 or higher (see tentative schedule); failure to do so will result in a 5% penalty on the final grade
3
peer reviews should be submitted to the ta no later than 8am of the due date
all team members are required to be present at the time of the final delivery
o it should include a plain text readme file that documents the list of contents
cost, time, technology limitations) and of relevant industry standards used (e.g.
document preparation all major documents (proposal, cdr, and final documentation) should contain a title page, an outline, as well as clear section and subsection headings, etc
