detailed course description cpsc 48 2 is a project -oriented course aimed at developing system integration skills
students work in groups of 3-5 people to complete a significant engineering design project
every project requires complete implementation, documentation and demonstration of a computing system design with both hardware and software components
the focus is not only on the final product but also on desig n methodology, management process and teamwork
each team will be required to manage its own efforts to complete its proje ct in a timely manner
since the projects will be student managed , the exact nature and style of these meetings is at the group’s discretion
at the end of the semester, each group will make a public presentation describing and demonstrating their work
the se presentations will be open to the university community
course objectives to prepare students for engineering practice with a major design experience based on the knowledge and skills acquired in earlier course work and incorporating en gineering standards and realistic constraints that include most of the following considerations: economic; environmental; sustainability; manufac turability; ethical; health and safety; social; and political
expected outcomes it is expected that successful participation in the course will allow the student to demonstrate: • analyze a complex computing problem and to apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions
• communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts
1
apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing -based solutions
a template for the proposal report and a presentation rubric are available on the course webpage
3 critical design review (10%) : the cdr is a mid -semester evaluation of your project
a template for the cdr report and a presentation rubric are available on the course webpage 
4 final communication (15%): this grade will be based on the quality of the final presentation (5%), as well as the contents and professional finish of the documentation (10%)
a template for the final report and a presentation rubric are available on the course webpage
2 weekly p rogress (10%): this grade will be based on your team’s ability to mai ntain the project on schedule
agenda for the weekly meeting with the instructor and the ta b
an overview of the plan of work for the following two weeks d
an update on project management, including teamwork, purchases, schedule and milestone status e
minutes of the previous meeting weekly progress reports are due two h ours prior to the time of the weekly meeting
the responsibility of preparing these reports will be rotated among team members
the team member preparing the report will also be in char ge of facilitating the discussions during that weekly meeting, and pre paring an action list for the following week
the action list contains the set of specific goals that each team member gas agreed to complete and a deadline for completing them
5 project grade (20%): a final grade will be assigned to your project based on the completion of all the objectives stated in the proposal, as well as on a live demonstration in front of the class
the complexity of your project and the size of your team w ill be factored in
this earlier deadline for the demo ensures that teams have time to prepare the final communication and fina l presentation
for items 1 -5: using github sites for your group and gra ding purposes: i.team
will use the tamu enterprise github to organize and trace course progress and materials
a lso, the activity log of the github will be used to access how each iv.individua
and wiki in order to provide documentation for their project
2% is given to the teamwork quiz and ii
notebook ( 5%): you are required to record what you do as a member of the project
a grade will be assigned to your personal design notebook based on: i
the regularity of your entries throughout the semester
ii
the evidence of an engineering design process, including but not limited to schematics, block diagrams, circ uits, pseudo -code, tables of experiment al results, and mathematical derivations
the clarity, legibility and organization of your annotations
electronic notebook can be either word file or pdf file
participation ( 4%): the instructor and ta will evaluate your attendance to meetings, participation in the discussions, and contributions to the team
item (6) above
there are three pe er reviews throughout the semester
github insights (10%): all projects will be hosted on tamu’s enterprise github (github.
through proper version control techn iques, your individual work history on the project will be documented
you will be required to maintain a stable master project b ranch by implementing features on separate working branches and creating pull requests for the entire team to review and merge into the master branch
you will be assigned a grade for your github contributions based on: i
(3%) the regularity of your commit history throughout the semester
ii
(4%) the quality and quantity of code and documentation you committed to the project throughout the semester
iii
online cou rse about ethics (2%) : we will provide an online ethics cours e in canvass
autodrive challenge participation extra credit (max 5%): all projects this semester are facilitated through the texas a&m unmanned team as part of the gm/sae autodrive challen ge
preparing or presenting team reports for the autodrive competition
note : grades will not be assigned until all project deliverables have been turned in (see below), all borrowed items (e.g.
keys, books, equipment) have been returned to their proper locati on or their owner, and the workstations in the lab have been thoroughly cleaned up
final deliverables 1) final doc umentation and project materials in electronic zip file with name as team_name_ project_report.zi
under the google site of the project
the detailed materials should includ e the following (please organize into folders, e.g.
docs, sour ce, hardware, media, references, freeware , videos ) a) designs: code, schematics, data, data sheets, freeware software tools, etc
b) reports: proposal, cdr, weekly reports, final report, and all presentations c) audiovisual media: close -up pictures of your system *and* a high-quality movie demo of the system working, for posterity 
document preparation all major documents (proposal, cdr, and final documentation) should be submitted in a professional format (e.g.
pl ease run a spell check before submitting
