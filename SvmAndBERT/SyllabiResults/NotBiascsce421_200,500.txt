grading policy 1
4 assignments (each includes written and programming components), 12% each = 48%
download the ipynb file and submit it to canvas
after completing each problem in the homework, "pin" the revision
hand-written notes may be included in the notebook (scan or photo)
if you are using a local jupyter notebook install, submit your history (run the following command) %history -g -f filename.lo
2
2 exams (midterm 23%, final 23%) = 46% exam will be conducted on canvas in class, in-person
3
4/11the fixed midterm and final dates
forged signatures will lead to 'f'
if you find solutions to homeworks or programming assignments on the web (or in a book, etc.)
check with the instructor first to determine if you can use it or not
assignments turned in that are significantly similar will be reported to the aggie honor system of fice
there will be no make up exams unless it is due to a genuine emergency defined by university rules
(2) interview trips that got scheduled at the last moment, etc
instructor may choose to give an oral exam instead of a written exam
course schedule topics: 1
dimensionality reduction: pca, factor analysis, multidimensional scaling, isomap, locally linear embedding 5
genetic algorithms, neuroevolution 6
