performance trade -offs of different implementations; asymptotic analysis of running time and memory usage
includes the execution of stude nts programs written in c++; emphasis on adherence to good software engineering principles
course prerequisites  csce 121 " introduction to program design and concepts"  csce 222 " discrete structures " or math 302 " discre te mathematics " (at-least co - requisite) course learning outcomes at the end of this course students should be able to: 1
textbook and/or resource materials  recommended textbooks: o “data s tructures and algorithm analysis in c++”, 4th edition, mark a

o you may need a textbook on c++ language from the previous semester, or any good c++ reference book(s)
grading policy  grading scale: 90 -100 – a; 80 - <90 – b; 70 - <80 – c; 60- <70 – d; below 60 – f
take home if incomplete and submit for 20% of the points by the end of the day
rubrics weightage (%) range of marks grade assignments 35 90 – 100 a labs 15 80 – <90 b midterm 10 70 – <80 c final 15 60 – <70 d quiz 15 < 60 f peer reviews 10 note about graded materials:  assignments – the first question will be about writing the pseudocode for the assignment (30%) (unless stated otherwise)
o you are allowed to discuss with your peers, but those discussions should be limited to logic and the concepts
we have tools that detect plagiarism, including similar code logic and program flow
o you must mentio n the names of the students you discussed the concepts with
o the code should have comments explaining the logic of the code
if there is any block of code tha t is doing something logical, briefly explain the logic for doing so, briefly (ideally in 2 – 3 sentences)
if not completed in the lab, complete it by the end of the day to receive partial credit (20%)
they will com ment on: o the correctness of the pseudocode/algorithm
o how the pseudocode/algorithm could be improved
o and how the reviewee’s own pseudocode/algorithm either dealt with what the reviewer got wrong, and/or how the reviewee can fix mistakes in their pseudoco de/algorithm
note: the review should be about the logic, rather than focused on the syntax
attendance – attendance is highly recommended, but not a graded component
late work policy unless a student has taken permission for submitting late, the following rules will apply:  we will follow a cumulative grading system 
th is also means that if you submit your assignment before the deadline, those number of days will be subtracted from your late days tally
 if in-spite of submitting any initial assignments late, all assignments are submitted before or on the deadline day of the 4th assignment, no late penalty will be incurred
per e very late day from the final score of the assignments 
will be deducted from 90 (totaling 77.5)
in the final score, 77.
will be cons idered for the 35% component of the grading scale instead of 90
work submitted by a student as makeup work for an excused absence is not considered late work and is exempted from the late work policy
