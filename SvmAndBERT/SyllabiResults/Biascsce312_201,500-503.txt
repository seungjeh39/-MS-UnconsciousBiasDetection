it is highly recommended to be familiar with the material ahead of the corresponding lecture
this course will focus on the topics shown below, which may not be covered in this order, or at all, if time does not permit it

some material covered in the lectures may not be found in the textbook or the slides
missed exams, quizzes and class presentations may be made up only for a university-excused absence
3.
the grade will be computed as follows: course grading projects 15% pop quiz/homework 15% laboratory assignments 20% quizzes 25% final exam 25% extra credit assignments and extra credit for significant class participation may be offered
letter grades will be assigned as follows: 90-100% a, 80-89% b, 70-79% c, 60-69% d, < 60% f
note that there is no mid-term exam
the quizzes and final exam will be closed book and closed notes (unless otherwise stated)
the nature of the course material is such that the final exam must be cumulative
laboratory exercises: labs are intended to prepare you to tackle the projects, and you will typically be able to complete labs during the assigned lab period
to obtain credit for a lab you typically must obtain a “check-off” from your teaching assistant, signifying that you completed the work during the scheduled lab time
a written proposal and a final report will be required
the correct approach is to start working on assignments as early as possible and contact us when you encounter difficulties
3.
deadline policy turn in all work by the established deadline
late work can be accepted only under circumstances beyond student's control and after arrangement with the ta or instructor, prior to the deadline
it will always be better to turn work in by the deadline, as trying to "perfect" it and turning it in late will give you no points at all
3.
submission of work and late submission policy all assignments/deliverables must be submitted electronically, by the due date and time, using the turn-in procedure on csnet
a student will earn points when he/she submits the assignment on time, by the partial credit policy
note that emailsubmissions will not be accepted (they will be ignored without notice)
you have to follow the submission and media policies and guidelines published on the course web site
in general, late submission will be penalized with a loss of 25% of the total points earned per day late
3.
to request re-grading you have to follow the guidelines below
re-grading requests must be submitted at most one week after the item has been graded and returned to the student and solutions have been made public
re-grading requests must be as specific as possible and must be accompanied by a reasonable amount of justification and documentation
3
e-mails must be sent to tas and the instructor within the one week time limit
3.
excused absences and make-up policy make-ups for assignments and exams will be given only for university-excused absences
prior arrangements with the instructor must be made when feasible and official verification of circumstances necessitating the absence will be required, as permitted by the texas a&m university student rules (http://student-rules.tamu.edu)
