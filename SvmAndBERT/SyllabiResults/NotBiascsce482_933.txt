● the wisdom of teams: creating the high-performance organization , by jon r
katzenbach and douglas k
detailed course description csce 482 is a project-oriented course aimed at developing system integration skills
students work in groups of 3-5 people to complete a significant engineering design project
every project requires complete implementation, documentation and demonstration of a computing system design with both hardware and software components
each team will be required to manage its own efforts to complete its project in a timely manner
group members will be required to keep individual lab notebooks recording their efforts and their personal impressions of the project
students will be graded based on both the quality of the group product and their individual contributions
every team will be required to schedule a weekly meeting with the course instructor and the ta, preferably during the official class or lab hours
these meetings must be attended by every group member
since the projects will be student managed, the exact nature and style of these meetings is at the group’s discretion
at the end of the semester, each group will make a public presentation describing and demonstrating their work
these presentations will be open to the university community
course objectives to prepare students for engineering practice with a major design experience based on the knowledge and skills acquired in earlier course work and incorporating engineering standards and realistic constraints that include most of the following considerations: economic; environmental; sustainability; manufacturability; ethical; health and safety; social; and political
● design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program’ s discipline
● apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing-based solutions
grading policy the final grade you will receive in the class will be based on points accumulated during the semester
1
a template for the proposal report and a presentation rubric are available on the course webpage
critical design review (10%) : the cdr is a mid-semester evaluation of your project
the grade will be based on your progress to date, and the quality of the oral presentation and accompanying written report
a template for the cdr report and a presentation rubric are available on the course webpage 
3
a template for the final report and a presentation rubric are available on the course webpage
weekly progress (10%): this grade will be based on your team’s ability to maintain the project on schedule
agenda for the weekly meeting with the instructor and the ta b
an update on project management, including teamwork, purchases, schedule and milestone status e
minutes of the previous meeting weekly progress reports are due two hours prior to the time of the weekly meeting
the responsibility of preparing these reports will be rotated among team members
the team member preparing the report will also be in charge of facilitating the discussions during that weekly meeting, and preparing an action list for the following week
the action list contains the set of specific goals that each team member has agreed to complete and a deadline for completing them
5
project grade (20%): a final grade will be assigned to your project based on the completion of all the objectives stated in the proposal, as well as on a live demonstration in front of the class
the complexity of your project and the size of your team will be factored in
due date: project demonstrations will take place 48 hours prior to the final presentation (or the friday prior if on a weekend)
this earlier deadline for the demo ensures that teams have time to prepare the final communication and final presentation
teams will use the tamu enterprise github (https://github.tamu.edu/
to organize and trace course progress and materials
the activity log there will be used to assess how each individual contributed to the team as well
6
these accomplishments should not come at the expense of destroying relationships among team members
is there evidence that the group engaged in team building activities? were contributions to the project evenly distributed? were members equally engaged in discussions during meetings? was there an effective division of responsibilities? among the 10%: i
the project grade is a direct outcome of teamwork
individua l performance (30%): points in this category are awarded based on assessments of your personal contribution to the team efforts: a
notebook (5%): you are required to record what you do as a member of the project
a grade will be assigned to your personal design notebook based on: i
the regularity of your entries throughout the semester
the evidence of an engineering design process, including but not limited to schematics, block diagrams, circuits, pseudo-code, tables of experimental results, and mathematical derivations
iii
the clarity, legibility and organization of your annotations
electronic notebook can be either word file or pdf file
b
participation (4%): the instructor and ta will evaluate your attendance to meetings, participation in the discussions, and contributions to the team
item (6) above
peer review (9%): your performance will be evaluated by each of your team members throughout the semester
there are three peer reviews throughout the semester
github insights (10%): all projects will be hosted on tamu’s enterprise github (github.tamu.edu)
through proper version control techniques, your individual work history on the project will be documented
you will be required to maintain a stable main project branch by implementing features on separate working branches and creating pull requests for the entire team to review and merge into the main branch
you will be assigned a grade for your github contributions based on: i
(3%) the regularity of your commit history throughout the semester
ii
(4%) the quality and quantity of code and documentation you committed to the project throughout the semester
e
online course about ethics (2%) : we will provide an online ethics course in canvas
note : grades will not be assigned until all project deliverables have been turned in (see below), all borrowed items (e.g.
keys, books, equipment) have been returned to their proper location or their owner, and the workstations in the lab have been thoroughly cleaned up
final deliverables a usb key including the following: 1) final documentation and project materials in electronic zip file with name as team_name_project_report.zip
the detailed materials should include the following (please organize into folders, e.g.
docs, source, hardware, media, references, freeware, videos) a) designs: code, schematics, data, data sheets, freeware software tools, etc
b) reports: proposal, cdr, weekly reports, final report, and all presentations c) audiovisual media: close-up pictures of your system *and* a high-quality movie demo of the system working, for posterity
coding, interfaces, safety)
