 we do not expect any background knowledge in quantum computing nor in quantum physics
you should know how to multiply a matrix with a vector, but the most important prerequisite is simply an open mind
course learning outcomes at the end of this course, students should understand the basics of the quantum circuit model, be able to understand fundamental quantum algorithm s, and ways to protect quantum information

csce 640 students will be expected to solve some slightly more challenging homework problems
final grades will be assigned according to this scale: a: 90 and above, b: [80,90), c: [70,80), d:[60,70), f: below 60 a slight curve might be applied if the course average is low
• work submitted by a student as makeup work for an excused absence is not considered late work and is exempted from the late work policy
(see student rule 7 .
regarding policy a student can request r egrading of any graded material if the student believes that the points assigned are inconsistent with the quality and merits of the submitted work
to request re -grading the student needs to follow the guidelines below: 1
regrading requests must be submitt ed to the instructor within one week after the graded item has been returned to the student
regrading requests must be in written form, accompanied by a reasonable amount of specific justificat ion and documentation
