for detailed information course description : this is an introductory course designed for any student interested in using computation to enhance their problem-solving abilities
learning objectives - develop a basic understanding of programming and the python programming language
- see the value of programming in a variety of different disciplines—especially as it relates to your other college courses
- appreciate the value of experimentation
course material and announcements - class lectures: the material that you will need for this class will be presented in the online class lecture
thus, it is extremely important that you attend every class
- canvas: course announcements, lecture materials, and class handouts can be found on canvas
you are responsible for consulting canvas regularly for course updates
each topic will be explored with numerous in-class examples followed by practice with lab assignments
• what is programming? why is it important? • simple input/output (input, print) • variables and expressions • collective data structures (strings, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries) • decision-making statements (if, if/else, if/elif/else) • repetition / loops (while, for) • randomness • functions • simulation • file-processing • binary numbers • visualization (turtle) required text : there is no textbook for this course
however, there are many good references that are available online that you may find helpful while studying the material
