page 3 of 7 programming assignments in addition to 3 written homeworks, t here will be 3 programming assignments throughout the semester
the programming assignments will be done in c++ (individually)
the code for course projects will be submitted via github.tamu.edu
students will have to create a (private) repository for this class, and then share that with the instructor and ta by making them collaborators 
the date and time studen ts turn in each project will be determined by the timestamp of their commits on their files
server by each deadline
