law necessarily lags technology resulting in an uncertain legal and ethical framework which requires cyber workers to be able to analyze and distinguish appropriate courses of action as part of their daily tasks without the luxury of relying on legal counsel
this is especially crucial given the dynamics of the threat and response landscape, the course will focus on international and federal law and not specific state data breach laws other than a cursory review and explanation of w hen states or federal has jurisdiction
course prerequisites junior , senior , or graduate classification
preferred to have some programming experience although not required
a ll assignments and exams for undergraduate and graduate students are weighted differently as explained in the grading policy section below with all sections having the same assignments and exams 
• demonstrate th e ability to use legal knowledge by analyzing cybersecurity issues from a cyber worker perspective such as whether a security incident violates a privacy principle or legal standard requiring specific legal action
• evaluate the relationship between ethics and law, describe civil disobedience and its relation to ethical hacking, describe criminal penalties related to unethical hacking, and apply the notion of “grey areas” to describing situations where law has not yet caught up to technological innovation
• describe steps for carrying out ethical penetration testing, describe 'ethical hacking' principles and conditions, distinguish between ethical and unethical hacking, and distinguish between nuisance hacking, activist hacking, cri minal hacking, and acts of war
