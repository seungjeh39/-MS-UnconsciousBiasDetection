appointment course description from the csce course catalog:specification and implementation of basic abstract data types and their associated algorithmsincluding stacks, queues, lists, sorting and selection, searching, graphs, and hashing; performancetradeoffs of different implementations and asymptotic analysis of running time and memory usage;includes the execution of student programs written in c++
data structures and algorithms is one of the core cs classes because it covers fundamentals of storingand processing data while introducing design and analysis of algorithms
many coding interviews,programming tests, and future classes will depend on material from this class
course prerequisites pre-requisit es: csce 121 (introduction to program design and concepts) orcsce 113 (intermediate programming & design) co-requisit es:csce 222 / ecen 222 (discrete structures for computing) ormath 302 (discrete mathematics) course learning outcomes this course details key concepts in computer science, aligning closely with the two tightly-integratedfields in the title: “data structures” and “algorithms.
accordingly, the content and expected outcomesare structured along these paths
-apply big-o asymptotic notation toevaluate and select efficient algorithmsfor a given problem with respect totimeand memory usage
textbook and resources textbookrecommended textbook:data structures and algorithm analysis in c++by markweiss, 4th ed
while this book is widely used in the field, there are many other c++ guidesand websites that you may find helpful to consult as well
canvascanvas will contain class materials, assignment descriptions, and grades
youcan access the course on canvas through your howdy portal
piazz a piazza will be used for q&a, announcements, and as a forum for other questions in the class
piazza ispreferred over email so that others can benefit from seeing the answers to your questions
you can alsoask private questions to the instructor and ta
88266112) csce 221 syllabuspage2of7 mimirlab and programming assignments will be submitted through mimir
mimir is an auto-grading systemwhich can give you more direct feedback while allowing the instructor and ta flexibility to review manualportions of the assignments
you can self-enroll by visiting the link below and using the specified accesscode, or you may visit the direct enrollment link
alternatively, you will be auto-enrolled by the end ofthe add/drop period
code: 4c322d38c7) mimir direct enrollment gradesc opesome assignments, such as quizzes and exams, will be graded on gradescope where there are betteroptions for submitting online and handling print exams than canvas
grading scale this class will use a standard a, b, c, etc
labswill be held on mondays and wednesdays beforelecture
they will test concepts throughapplied problems and be guided by the ta with the help of our grading platforms
quizzeswill typically be short and held in-classabout once a week
following the goal of formativeassessment, individual quizzes are a low stakes way to evaluate concept understanding
•assignments:homeworksare take-home assignments that will notusually involve programming but will practiceconcepts related to the programming assignments and the overall course
programming assignmentscomprise the single largestportion of the course grade
these willrequire programming a solution to the given prompt and submitting your code and, if applicable,discussion of the results
because thisis a foundational class for the field, exams will include conceptual and applied problems
policies •attendance:the university views class attendance as the responsibility of an individual student
lab attendance will be evaluated based on your being present in the laband submitting the lab work
class attendance will be based on in-class activities and quizzes
•absences and make-up work:university rules related to excused/unexcused absences and make-up work are located in studentrule 7:http://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07
an unexcused absence on an exam will result in a zero
csce 221 syllabuspage4of7 •late submissions:typically, assignments are due at 11:59 pm on the day of the deadline
the penalty will be 15% every day, up to 4 days
after4 days, late work will receive no credit
additionally, you have a pool of 4 late days that you can use to extend an assignment an additional24 hours without penalty
while the assignments are organized so that you have plenty of time tocomplete them, late days give you extra flexibility to handle unforeseen circumstances according toyour own judgement
be sure tospecify the affected assignment
you are responsible for tracking your own late days! we willmaintain this information and will only allow up to 4 to be used
•accommodations:the division of student affairs has made a new portal available,disability accommodation portal(aim), which you can use to request and send accommodationletters
