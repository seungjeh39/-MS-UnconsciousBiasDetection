a subset of each homework will be graded for correctness
the other problems will be graded for completeness only 
3/9final exam: 200 points a >= 900 points b = 800-899 points c = 700-799 points d = 600-699 points f = <600 points regrading policy we will make an ef fort to complete the grading of work within one week of the turnin date
only if you can prove to the grader that your solution is correct and complete will your work be regraded
