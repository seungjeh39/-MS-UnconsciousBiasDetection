3 lectur e hours
2 lab hours introduction to computer systems from programmer's perspective: simple logic design, data representation and processor architecture, programming of processors, memory , control ﬂow , input/output, and performance measurements; hands-on lab assignments
junior or senior classiﬁcation or approval of instructor 
from the professor: think of the computer as an automobile
so far , you have begun to learn how to drive, that is, to program the computer in a high-level programming language
but what goes on under the hood? that is, what are the mechanisms underneath the programming language that cause your program to execute? this class will provide an answer to that question
you will learn a little about digital logic design
you will learn how simple electronic devices are linked together to form the complex computer systems we use
you will see how information is represented and how representations can have an impact on the programs you write
many of the mysteries behind the sometimes strange behavior of high-level programming languages will be revealed
2/3programming language called assembly language that is part of the interface between software and hardware
you will learn how details of the implementation of the computer , such as the memory system, can af fect the performance of your programs
thus, you will become a better programmer 
this class has two big parts: digital logic design and assembly language
assembly language is the bigger part so we'll do digital logic design ﬁrst
there are little parts, too, that we'll pick up along the way
about the lab section your teaching assistant will lead a lab covering the topics presented the lecture
the t a will administer quizzes, discuss assignments, answer you questions, and in general serve as a resource to give you a better idea of what is going on in the class than your crazy absent-minded professor can
we'll have several homework assignments, many requiring programming
quizzes: (20% of grade)
there will be quizzes in the lab section
there will be one or two exams during the semester 
last exam: (30% of grade)
there will be a "last" exam near the end of the semester 
policy on assignments and t ests late assignments are not accepted
make-up tests are generally not given except for university sanctioned reasons, such as religious holidays, documented illnesses, catastrophic events, or other grave situations
share program code or read each others writeups
