 there are people that believe one or t wo computer science classes should be included in this list
like english (in an english speaking location) is required to be able to communicate with people, more and more, we need to communicate with machines
 with such a large base of software now, one can focus on their specialty and not have to be a “computer scientist” to make good use of computing
what ’s next ? students completing this course should be able to:  feel comfortable using a computer
in the 1950s, the idea of dedicating a computer to entertainment was unthinkable; today revenues from the computer game industry exceed hollywood
more humans own a computer than own a toothbrush and apple is one of the world’s largest company having overtaken many oil, agriculture, and manufacturing sectors 
in the 21st century, learning to program a computer is empowerment
today’s students regardless of their ultimate field of study or occupation need this fundamental knowledge
 operators, math, random numbers, algorithms
switch statements, tree s, composing conditionals
 arrays and lists , enhanced for loops  combining branching looping and i/o  methods and classes  code refactoring, java libraries, objects, exceptions, code verification  file i/o  object creation and design  graphical user interface learning outcomes students completing this course should be able to:  use a text editor to program java code
 identify the basic syntax and semantics of the java programming language
 use appropriate commenting, layout, and naming to communicate code intent  understand the primitive data types built into the java language
 create java i/o interfaces  read, interpret, analyze, and explain introd uctory java programs

the grading s cale expected to be used is: a >= 1050 points > b >= 950 points > c >= 850 points d >= 750 points > f < 750 points the main path includes 4 categories 
a student must get 70% on each of the main assignment groups to get a c or better in the class
main categories 4 of the 11 pathways make up the main categories that need to be mastered to be successful in this class
to pass the class you must pass the core categories 
to get a c or better in the class, you must get 70% or better in the core categories

you must archive 350 points for this to count towards your point total
you must archive 140 points for this to count towards your point total
you must be pr esent for milestone checks and project demonstrations to receive credit for your project
if you show mastery in this topic (score 70 or more) these points can go to your total
those who get less than full credit, down to zero credit, do not make the highest grades
discussions weekly discussions account for 100 points
