 page 1 of 5 syllabus course title and number csce 438-500: distributed systems and 438-200: hnr-distributed systems term spring 2022 meeting times and location tu, th 11:10am - 12:25pm, zach 350 course description and prerequisites the goals of this course are for students to gain an understanding of the principles and techniques (e.g.
locking, concurrency, scheduling, communication across networks, fault tolerance) behind the design of distributed processing systems, such as google, facebook, amazon, yahoo and microsoft, and to gain practical experience designing, implementing, and debugging real distributed systems
hnr students will work on a class project
be able to clearly elucidate their benefits, drawbacks, and limitations
● debug highly concurrent code that spans multiple programs running on multiple machines ● reason about distributed algorithms for locking, synchronization and concurrency, scheduling, and replication students in 438h will investigate distributed ledger, smart contracts and blockchain, will be stimulated to propose new ideas for addressing existing problems and write a report
