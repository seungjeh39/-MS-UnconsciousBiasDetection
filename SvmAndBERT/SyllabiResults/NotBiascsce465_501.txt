 office hours: will be posted on canvas course description fundamental concepts and principles of computer security , operating system and network security , secret key and public key cryptographic algorithms, hash functions, authentication, firewalls and intrusion detection systems, ipsec and vpn, wireless and web security 
2/8none course learning outcomes this course primarily aims at providing a level of literacy in information security adequate enough to understand the security implications on a number of diverse domains including software engineering; networking; privacy; and policy 
a secondary objective is to provide a working knowledge of topics such as cryptography , privacy , network security , and infrastructure management, so that students can acquire the necessary background for more advanced security courses
by the end of this course, students will be able to reason about systems from the perspective of a security engineer 
grading policy homeworks: 550 points (distributed across 6 homeworks)
y our assignments must be typed and in pdf format
never copy someone else’ s words and turn them in
for example, “the academic integrity policy on this syllabus was based on one obtained from prof
jennifer w elch”, or “sally smith walked me through the solution to #38 and then i did #39 on my own” (assuming #38 was not on the homework)
3/8a >= 900 points b = 800-899 points c = 700-799 points d = 600-699 points f = <600 points we will make an ef fort to complete the grading of work within one week of the turnin date
version control you are strongly encouraged to use a version control system to track changes and back up your work
that you can use
do not create public repositories containing your assignment solutions as this may lead to unauthorized copying of your work and a violation of the aggie code of honor
