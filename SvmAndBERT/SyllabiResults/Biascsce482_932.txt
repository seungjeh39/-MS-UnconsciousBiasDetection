___________________________________________________________________________ catalog d escription csce 482 & 483 : engineering design; working as a design -team member, conceptual design methodology, design evaluations, total project planning and management techniques, design optimization, systems manufacturing costs considerations; emphasis placed upon student's activities as design professionals
course prerequisites csce 483: (csce 315 or csce 331) and csce 462 and ecen 325, and senior classification csce 482: (csce 315 or csce 331) and csce 411 and, senior classification textbook and references required • the five dysfunctions of a team: a leadership fable by patrick m
katzenbach and douglas k
smith, collins (2003)
available on -line at tamu libraries
supplemental • technical material from the literature, manufacturer’s datasheets and user manuals
group members will be required to keep individual lab notebooks recording their efforts and their personal impressions of the project
students will be graded based on both the quality of the group product and their individual contri butions
every team will be required to schedule a weekly meeting with the course instructor and the tas, preferably during the official class or lab hours
however, every member of the group is expected to participate 
• recognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgments in computing practice based on legal and ethical principles
• function effectively as a member or leader of a team engaged in activities appropriate to the program’s discipline
grading policy the final grade you will receive in the class will be based on points accumulated during the semester
thus, both continued progress (the process) and the quality of your product (and other deliverables) will determine your grade
1 project proposal ( 5%): these points will be based on (1) the originality, creativity and feasibility of the proposed work, the analysis of alternative solutions, the consideration of economic and societal aspects, the project management approach ( 3%), and (2) the quality of the oral presentation ( 2%)
the grade will be based on your progress to date, and the quality of the oral presentation and accompanying written report
the weekly report should be incremental , and should specifically address the following: a
agenda for the weekly meeting with the instructor and the ta b
any major accomplishments during this time period , including figures and results c
an update on project management, including teamwork, purchases, schedule and milestone status e
this earlier deadline for the demo ensures that teams have time to prepare the final communication and fina l presentation
all ii.require
group materials such as project proposal, weekly report, cdr, final report and presentation files, iii.shoul
be shared on the github
contributed to the team as well
tea ms should make use of github features such as the v.readm
6 teamwork (10 %); it is very important to understand that accomplishing the technical objectives of the project is not sufficient
these accomplishments should not come at the expense of destroying relationships among team members
thus, a grade will be assigned based on t he ability of the group to function as a team
is there evidence that the group engaged in team building activities? were contributions to the project evenly distributed? were members equally engaged in discussions during meetings? was there an effective division of responsibilities? the project grade is direct outcome of teamwork
among the 10%, i
8% is determined by final evaluation of teamwork effectiveness
teamwork grade level cannot be higher than project grade
entries in the notebook should be made during or shortly after every work session
each entry should include (1) the date, (2) the objectives for that session, and (3) record of what was done
the evidence of an engineering design process, including but not limited to schematics, block diagrams, circ uits, pseudo -code, tables of experimental results, and mathematical derivations
you can choose either paper -based notebook or electronic -based notebook: paper -based notebooks must have permanent binding (i.e.
composition pads); spiral -bound notebooks will not be accepted , failing to do so will result in a 5% penalty on the final grade
the file should be cumulative which contain s all the information from the beginning of the class
b
team leaders will instead be evaluated by their ability to make the group operate as a team, i.e.
c
amu.edu)
all project code should be managed, from the project beginning, in this system
for example, if you only submit codes at the last week of semester, you will lose the three points
note: code quality including metrics such as structure, readability, and efficiency will be weighted more heavily than the number of lines of code committed
(4%) adherence to good version control prac tices such as using branches to develop new features without affecting the master branch, avoiding bundling unrelated changes into single commits, and writing good commit messages
e
preparing or presenting team reports for the autodrive competition
students may be offered extra credit for volunteering for such tasks in proportion t o the effort required
all team members are required to be present at the time of the final delivery unless due to excused absence allowed by student rule 7
under the google site of the project
it should include a plain text readme file that documents the list of contents
the detailed materials should includ e the following (please organize into folders, e.g.
cost, time, technology limitations) and of relevant industry standards used (e.g.
coding, interfaces, safety)
document preparation all major documents (proposal, cdr, and final documentation) should be submitted in a professional format (e.g.
spiral -binding), and should contain a title page, an outline, as well as clear section and subsection headings, etc
