 1/15s y l l ab u s senior capstone design effective design requires identifying the “right” problem to solve, building components that meet that problem’ s needs, and integrating components into a single solution system
as problems become more challenging, solid design, follow through, and teamwork skills become necessary to developing a solution
after this course, you will be able to: analyze a complex computing problem and identify solutions using computing principles, design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of requirements, apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing- based solutions, collaborate effectively as a member of a team, recognize professional responsibilities, both legal and ethical, and make informed judgements in computing practice, and communicate you will work in groups of 4-5 people to complete a significant engineering design project
every project requires complete implementation, documentation, evaluation, and demonstration of a computing system design
the focus is not only on the final product but also on design methodology , management process, and teamwork
at the end of the semester , each group will make a public presentation describing and demonstrating their work
why i teach this course this course of fers you a unique learning experience
the t a and i are always especially excited to teach this course, and here is why: you finally get to combine everything that you have learned throughout your entire undergraduate curriculum
this not only includes the computer science skills you have gained, but also the professional, cultural, and communication skills that you have developed
this is an opportunity for you to try to solve a problem that matters to you
this course gives you a lot of freedom and choice in your semester-long project
this course can be the first step towards moving to the career of your choice
2/15building a system from start to finish is fun and rewarding
students often tell me that this was the greatest experience of their entire college career 
working on teams can be messy , but it’ s worth it
it is amazing what you can accomplish together , so much more than on your own
w orking on real problems with real people has its challenges, but it is also very rewarding when you successfully complete your goals
every semester is different, every team is different, every solution is different
there is always something new to learn and innovate
smaller class sizes and weekly meetings allow you to connect with your classmates and your instructor 
about working in teams because your teammates' grades are so tightly coupled with your own dedication to the class, many of the assignments and rules are put in place to protect you and your teammates
these include requirements to participate actively in class, complete assignments in a timely manner , and treat your classmates with respect
weekly status update meetings: hold a weekly meeting with the course instructor and the t as during the of ficial class hours
since the projects will be student managed, the exact nature and style of these meetings is at the group’ s discretion, e.g.
division of tasks among group members

course learning outcomes this course will prepare you for engineering practice with a major design experience based on the knowledge and skills you acquired in earlier course work
after this course you will be able to: analyze a complex computing problem and to apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions
design, implement and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program's discipline
4/15communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts
collaborate effectively as a member or leader of a team engaged in activities appropriate to the program's discipline
apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing- based solutions
we will cover man topics including: identifying engineering problems project management tools ethics in the discipline communicating problem motivation and needs exploring existing solutions designing a computing system and user interface evaluating a computing system through user studies and benchmark testing analyzing and interpreting data communicating and summarizing results, both written and orally textbook and/or resource materials required: design of everyday things

grading components: your grade for this course reflects your mastery of course material and is determined by multiple components
note that you will not receive a passing grade in the class if you do not have a tested and working system by the end of the semester 
component percentage written communication elements 20% oral communication elements 15% final deliverables and individual contribution30% project management 5% testing 15% status updates 5% daily quizzes 2% peer feedback and peer evaluation3% ethics 5% total 100% written communication elements - 20%: you will have several technical writing assignments including (but not limited to) problem formation, related literature review , project proposals, documentation, and your final report
y our writing will be critiqued on its thoroughness and effectiveness in communicating key aspects of your system such as its motivation, approach, evaluation, and engineering standard
y our d ocumentation will be critiqued on its completeness to properly execute and understand the details of your system
some assignments will require you to incorporate peer feedback to refine your work
oral communication elements - 15%: you will have several presentation assignments including (but not limited to) a critical design review , a final presentation, and demonstrations
y ou will have opportunity to practice presenting both posters and more formal slide presentations
some assignments will require you to incorporate peer feedback to refine your communication
