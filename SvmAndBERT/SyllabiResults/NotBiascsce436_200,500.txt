 human-computer interaction - csce 436 (spring 2022) seminar + studio combined class
in this class, you will learn various details of cutting-edge technologies and prototyping techniques to make tangible computers for human-computer interaction
this class intends to provide a general understanding of hci theories, design principles, design & implementation techniques, then to offer fundamental skills for prototyping to investigate users’ needs in product/system development

midterm 1: youtube video on the deployment of your flipped affordance final project: prototype of your own interactive system/machine invention 1
project website showcasing your work; ■ introduction and motivation: what important real-world issue does this solve? ■ descriptions of system design/development processes ■ photos of your prototype ■ video of your usage scenario (walkthrough) 2
presentation of your final project requirements ● no prerequisite, i welcome all students with various backgrounds (cs/ce, ee, me, architecture, design, material science, etc.
● there will be a random selection of class activity presenters, if you miss the class so miss the presentation without notice, your final grade will be downgraded by one letter grade ● always bring something to sketch with ● no texting/facebooking/instagramming during the class -- no exception ● be ready for heavy hands-on studio activities and projects; you will be likely to spend 3+ hours/week ● this class will introduce a wide variety of topics in rapid prototyping and late-breaking interaction technologies with very quick turnarounds
● bring your own passion and motivation-- this course will help you build your portfolio & research experiences with quality, not your course credits with quantity reading week 1: ■ reflective physical prototyping through integrated design, test, and analysis (uist’06) by björn hartmann, scott r
