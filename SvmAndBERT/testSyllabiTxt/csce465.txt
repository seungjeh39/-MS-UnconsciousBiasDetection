syllabus course title and number computer and network security: csce 465 term (e.g., fall 200x) fall 2022 meeting times and location csce 465 -501 mw 4:10pm-5:25pm hrbb 124 csce 465 -201 mw 4:10pm -5:25pm hrbb 124 course description and prerequisites fundamental concepts and principles of computer security, operating system and network security, secret key and public key cryptographic algorithms, hash functions, authentication, firewalls and intrusion detection systems, ipsec and vpn, wireless and web security. prerequisite: csce 313 and csce 315; junior or senior classification; or approval of instructor. learning outcomes or course objectives this course primarily aims at providing a level of literacy in information security adequate enough to understand the security implications on a number of diverse domains including software engineering; networking; privacy; and policy. a secondary object ive is to provide a working knowledge of topics such as cryptography, privacy, network security, and infrastructure management, so that students can acquire the necessary background for more advanced security courses. by the end of this course, students will be able to reason about systems from the perspective of a security engineer. that is, they should be able to deﬁne the system to protect; determine the security properties that are desired for this system; identify the possible threats to these securi ty properties, and their likelihood of occurrence; and consider possible mitigations against these threats. instructor information professor name prof. yupeng zhang (petr 220) telephone number 979-845-9980 (office) email address zhangyp@tamu.edu office hours tuesday 2 -3pm location petr220 teaching assistant name haidong wang (eaba 108b ) email address hdwang@tamu.edu office hours tuesday and thursday 4 -5pm location eaba 108b name avdhi shah (grader) email address avdhi.shah@tamu.edu textbook and/or resource material required textbook introduction to computer security, by michael goodrich and roberto tamassia, addison -wesley pearson, isbn -10: 0 -321-51294 -4 optional textbook handbook of applied cryptography – available online at: http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/ course website: https://tamucsce.github.io/csce465_fall2022/ piazza: piazza.com/tamu/fall202 2/csce465/home assignment and grading : https://gradescope.com course management : https://canvas.tamu.edu/ course policies attendance the university views class attendance as the responsibility of an individual student. attendance is essential to complete the course successfully. university rules related to excused and unexcused absences are located on -line at http://student -rules.tamu.edu/rule07 . if you have a conflict with a scheduled exam, please contact the professor as soon as possible, but no later than one week in advance to schedule a make -up. if your conflict is unforeseen (e.g. sudden hospitalization), please contact the professor as soon as possible to arrange a make -up. please provide your professor with documentation for excused absences. the lowest two quiz grades will be dropped. if you have three or more ex cused quiz absences, please coordinate with the professor for a make -up. late work policy late homeworks are not accepted and are worth 0 points. if you have an extended excused absence (per rule 7) that prevents you from completing a homework, please co ordinate with the professor as soon as possible for a make -up. grading scale homeworks: 500 points (distributed across 5 homeworks). your assignments must be typed and in pdf format. submit assignment to gradescope (https://www.gradescope.com) midterm exam: 200 points final exam: 300 points a >= 900 points b = 800 -899 points c = 700 -799 points d = 600 -699 points f = <600 points honors project: if you are in the csce 465 honors section, you have to take this option. if you are in normal sections, you may request this option. form a team to do an honors project, in which you design/implement/evaluate some useful and new attack/defense/system/tool/service/user study, etc. if you take this option, it r eplaces hw 5. talk to me asap if you want to take this option. course topics, calendar of activities, major assignment dates week topic required reading assignment 1 (aug 24) introduction security properties and principles security vocabulary gt ch. 1 2 (aug 29) os security program vulnerabilities gt ch. 3 3 (sep 5) program vulnerabilities 4 (sep 12) program vulnerabilities crypto – symmetric gt ch. 8.1 hw 1 due 5 (sep 19) crypto – symmetric gt ch. 8.5, 8.2 6 (sep 26) crypto – public gt ch. 8.3 -8.4 hw 2 due 7 (oct 3) crypto – hash functions and signatures, pki gt ch. 8.4 8 (oct 12) midterm exam midterm on oct 12 9 (oct 17) malware gt ch. 4 10 (oct 24) network security gt ch 5 gt ch 6.1 -6.4 hw 3 due 11 (oct 31) wireless security gt ch. 6.5 12 (nov 7) web security gt ch. 7 hw 4 due 13 (nov 14) web security gt ch. 7 14 (nov 21) security models gt ch. 9 15 (nov 28) bitcoin and ethereum hw 5 due 16 (dec 5) honor presentations final exam see: http://registrar.tamu.edu/courses, -registration, -scheduling/final -examination -schedules mw 4:10pm has final exam monday december 12 from 3:30pm -5:30pm version control you are strongly encouraged to use a version control system to track changes and back up your work. texas a&m has an institutional github account (https://github.tamu.edu) that you can use. do not create public repositories containing your assignment solutions as this may lead to unauthorized copying of your work and a violation of the aggie code of honor.
