introduction to models of computation, including nite state machines and turing machines. course prerequisites math 151 course learning outcomes at the end of the course, students will understand the basic principles of logic, proofs and sets. they will be able to apply results from discrete mathematics to the analysis of algorithms. they will be able to produce proofs by induction and apply counting techniques. they will have a basic understanding of models of computation. course activities, assessments, grading policy two midterm exams (each for 50 minutes) and one comprehensive nal exam (for 90 minutes): each exam is worth 20% of your grade. all three exams will be done online and proctored using zoom. the exam dates and times are as below. you will pick one time slot for each exam. more details will be available on canvas. {exam 1: tuesday, september 27. time 1: 1:00-1:50pm, time 2: 6:00-6:50pm {exam 2: tuesday, november 1. time 1: 1:00-1:50pm, time 2: 6:00-6:50pm {final exam: monday, december 12. time 1: 10:30am-12:00noon, time 2: 1:00-2:30pm 1 homework: there will be eight sets of problem solving homework, for which you are required to use the l atex typesetting system to type in your answers. all assignments will be an- nounced in the modules section in canvas and must be submitted using the submission link on canvas. one lowest homework grade will be dropped. practice quizzes: after watching a few video clips, you are required to take quiz on the contents discussed in the videos. one lowest practice quiz grade will be dropped. mastery quizzes: after studying a set of topics, you are required to take the mastery quiz on the topics. one lowest mastery quiz grade will be dropped. assessment category weight examsexam 1 20% exam 2 20% final exam 20% homework assignments 20% quizzespractice quizzes 10% mastery quizzes 10% final grades will be assigned according to this scale based on the weighted nal average: a: 90 and above, b: [80{90), c: [70{80), d: [60{70), f: below 60 the scale may be adjusted by the instructor to re ect score variations. textbook, resource materials, course technology lecture notes and resource materials: lectures will be based on the lecture notes on discrete structures written by dr. klappenecker and dr. lee (who is the instructor of this course). chap- ters from the lecture notes will be available for your reading for free on perusall according to the course schedule. you will nd the link to the perusall system in the navigation menu on canvas. supplemental material for your own additional reading is kenneth rosen's discrete mathematics and its applications 7th or later edition, mcgraw-hill, but this is optional. canvas: this course will use the tamu canvas lms (learning management system) as the virtual classroom. within canvas, you will nd all course-related content and assessments (including but not limited to course materials, schedule, links to videos, activities, assignments, etc.). the recom- mended browsers for canvas access are google chrome 98 and 99 or firefox 97 and 98 (extended releases are not supported), edge 98 and 99, and safari 14 and 15 (mac only). for additional information on supported browsers for canvas, please visit https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/canvas-basics-guide/tkb-p/basics and click on the question \what are the browser and computer requirements for canvas?" within canvas, the course navigation menu is located on the left. the syllabus and course intro- ductory materials can be found within the home section. the course content is presented within modules; once you are on the modules page, you access each weekly module. all due dates are posted within the modules. if you have any questions about navigating the canvas course website, please contact the instructor. 2 technology requirements: reliable and frequent access to a computer and to the high-speed internet. to attend virtual oce hours and take the zoom proctored exams, students need to make sure they have setup tamu zoom ( https://tamu.zoom.us ) to run on their computer(s) and mobile devices. the zoom links for oce hours are available in the zoom section in canvas. please prepare external microphone and webcam when using zoom if your device does not have those functionalities of decent quality. for the proctored online tests, students will need a second device with zoom installed so the proctor can see the student, the student's computer screen (on which the student is taking the test) and the student's surroundings while the student is taking the test. students will need the l atex typesetting system (installing it on their computer is strongly recommended). students will need to type in their solutions for the homework problems using latex. the system is freely available to download from the internet. for more information on l atex, visit https://ctan.org/starter or https://people.engr.tamu.edu/hlee42/csce222/getting-started-with-latex.pdf . course topics, calendar of activities, major exam dates: tentative schedule;
