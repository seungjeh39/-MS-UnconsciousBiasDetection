therefore, students are required to promptly and regularly attend all their classes. a record of attendance will be maintained from the first day of classes and/or the first day the student’s name appears on the roster through final examinations and will contribute t o the participation grade for the course. absences may only be excused as defined by the texas a&m university student rules available at http://student -rules.tamu.edu/rule07 . this course is stacked w ith csce 703/cybr 603. graduate students should enroll in those courses rather than cybr 403/csce 477 . in addition to all undergraduate (cybr 403/csce 477) work, graduate students will have additional requirements for the semester paper (i.e., longer paper, more references). requirement: undergraduate points: graduate points: 10 assignments (30 pts each) 5 individual;
