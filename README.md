# MS-UnconsciousBiasDetection

# README

## Introduction

Our application is a system that will take in a syllabi and return a score based on ML analysis.
The front end is set up and works, where a user enters in their syllabi and a bias score is
determined.

## Requirements

This code has been run and tested on:

- Python 3.9.6
- virtualenv
- all dependencies within "requirements.txt"

## External Deps

- Git - Downloa latest version at https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
- GitHub Desktop (Not needed, but HELPFUL) at https://desktop.github.com/

## Installation

Download this code repository by using git:

`git clone https://github.com/seungjeh39/MS-UnconsciousBiasDetection.git`

## Virtual Environment setup

Make sure that virutalenv is installed before beginning running code.
This can be done by the command: 'pip3 install virtualenv'.
A virtual env has been created and to activate, run the command 'source env/bin/activate'.
If in Windows, run '.\env\Scripts\activate' (in cmd).
to install all of the necessary dependencies and packages, run 'pip3 install -r requirements.txt'.
To view the dependencies and packages, run pip3 list.
The requirements.txt file has all of the necessary libraries and dependencies.

run deactivate to get out of virtual environment.

## File Structure
Within our system, we have structured the files and directories in an organized manner so that functions
can be pulled from anywhere within the system. The templates directory includes front end code, the SvmAndBERT
directory includes both the BERT and SVM models, and the NBmodel directory includes the Naive Bayes model. 

app.py is the main file that will link the front end and the back end; activating this file is detailed down below
and it is the main way of viewing our system output.

The available functions are ConvertTxtToCsv, ConvertTxtToTxtFile, GeneralBertBiasDetection(currentDirPath), and
GeneralBertBiasDetection(currentDirPath). They all work in conjunction to run models and determine bias scores
for different syllabi using the training dataset.

## Execute Code

The app.py file is the main file that will run all of the proper dependencies
as well as the front end.

To get app.py to run, simply navigate to the home directory (can check by using "pwd"),
and then run "python3 app.py" (or "python app.py" depending on your machine). Finally,
click on hyperlink http://127.0.0.1:5010/ in order to open the system in a web browser.  

## Deployment

We are planning on deploying to Heroku so that anyone can be able to view and use our
system. However, we feel as if it is not of the highest priority as of right now, and
we are focusing more on developing models and getting the system working locally.

After running app.py, go to http://127.0.0.1:5010/ to view the system.

## CI/CD

For continuous development/adding to the system, go to the "CONTRIBUTING.md" file
and read the details within there.

## Thanks and I hope you enjoy detecting bias in syllabi!!
