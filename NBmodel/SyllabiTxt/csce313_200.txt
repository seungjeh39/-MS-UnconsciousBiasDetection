Grading Policy  
 A: 90-100%, B: 80-89%, C: 70-79%, D: 60-69%, F: 0-59%  
Assignment Qty Format Percent of final grade 
Homework 4 Implementation and report 40% (10% each) 
Midterms 3 Closed-book 45% (15% each) 
Quizzes 3 Closed-book 15% (5% each) 
 
Late Work Policy  
 Homework submissions are due at 10 am. Late homework is accepta ble with a penalty of 20% of the original grade per day (no points after 5 days). Delays are rounded up to the nearest full day. Example: your homework scores 76 points, but is 28 hours late. Your sc ore is then reduced by 40 points and becomes 36.   
Homework  
 Each homework must be accompanied by a written report (if there  are multiple parts in the homework, the report applies only to the last part) describing your implementation and showing the performance analysis requested in the handout. Write in as much detail as possible, explain the various observations, and comment on the sanity of obtained  results.  This course assumes independent work on each assignment. All submissions must be original and developed from scratch. You may not copy any part of other students’ work, no matter how short, or material found online unless explicitly allowed by the instructor. In particular, no team work is allowed. If external sources are used, even with modification or adaptation, they must be clearly acknowledged in the submission. If unsure, check with t he instructor ahead of time. Any academic dishonesty, including cheating and plagiarism, will re sult in an F* for the course and may lead to expulsion from the university.
