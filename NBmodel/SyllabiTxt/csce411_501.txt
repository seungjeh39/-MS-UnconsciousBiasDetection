  Grading	Policy	 • Participation     2% • Homework assignments   25%  • Algorithm History/Application Essay   3% • Midterm 1    23%  • Midterm 2    23%  • Final exam     24%  The grading scale will be: A ≥ 91% > B ≥ 81% > C ≥ 71% > D ≥ 61% > F. If the course average is slow, a slight upward curve may be applied.  Your lowest homework assignment will be dropped  Attendance	and	participation	 Attendance will be taken indirectly via in-class polls. Participation grade can be met by in-class participation (e.g., answering questions, presenting answers to in-class activities, answering polling questions), and out-of-class engagement (e.g., answering questions on course messaging boards, submitting intro video). Students can guarantee full points for participation if they satisfy one of the following: (1) Uploading an intro video, plus participation in in-class polls on 10 different days, or (2) participating in in-class polls on 20 different days.   Late	Work	and	Makeup	Work	Policy	 Homework. Homework assignments may be submitted up to 24 hours late with a penalty of 25%. If it is submitted within 5 hours of the deadline, it will be graded with a smaller penalty of 5% x (number of hours since deadline). Work submitted more than 24 hours after the deadline will not be accepted. (Recall that your lowest homework assignment will be dropped.)  Tests. No make-up tests will be given. If a student needs to be absent from class on a test day due to an unavoidable and acceptable excused absence, that student needs to get approval from the instructor in advance. The absence must be acceptable as defined by TAMU’s policy and will require formal verification (e.g., a doctor’s note). If any tests are missed, the final grade will be computed using the weighted average of remaining assignments in the course (which includes other tests, homework assignments, and quizzes).  Homework	policy	 Although it is not required, you are encouraged to work on and complete all homework assignments on your own without consulting peers or outside sources.    Course	Syllabus

You are allowed, under a very specific set of guidelines, to consult outside sources and discuss homework problems with other students. However, the write-up must be entirely in your own words—copying is strictly prohibited and can result in academic integrity violations. Additionally, if you receive any type of help from outside resources or discuss problems with others, you are required to list all resources and collaborators in your homework write-up (e.g., existing webpages, textbooks, discussion with other students in the course or students outside the course, etc.). Discussing problems includes both receiving help or giving help of any kind. Posting homework questions or soliciting help in online sites or forums is strictly prohibited. E.g., while reading an existing post about a similar problem is okay, creating a new post asking for the answer to your question is not okay.

Makeup	Work	Policy	 Students will be excused from attending class on the day of a graded activity or when attendance contributes to a student’s grade, for the reasons stated in Student Rule 7, or other reason deemed appropriate by the instructor.   Please refer to Student Rule 7 in its entirety for information about makeup work, including definitions, and related documentation and timelines.  Absences related to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 may necessitate a period of more than 30 days for make-up work, and the timeframe for make-up work should be agreed upon by the student and instructor” (Student Rule 7, Section 7.4.1).  “The instructor is under no obligation to provide an opportunity for the student to make up work missed because of an unexcused absence” (Student Rule 7, Section 7.4.2).  Students who request an excused absence are expected to uphold the Aggie Honor Code and Student Conduct Code. (See Student Rule 24.)  Academic	Integrity	Statement	and	Policy	 “An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal, or tolerate those who do.”  “Texas A&M University students are responsible for authenticating all work submitted to an instructor. If asked, students must be able to produce proof that the item submitted is indeed the work of that student. Students must keep appropriate records at all times. The inability to authenticate one’s work, should the instructor request it, may be sufficient grounds to initiate an academic misconduct case” (Section 20.1.2.3, Student Rule 20).
