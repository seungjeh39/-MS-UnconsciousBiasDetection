Campus Safety MeasuresTo promote public safety and protect students, faculty, and staff during the coronavirus pandemic,Texas A&M University has adopted policies and practices for the Summer 2021 academic term tolimit virus transmission. Students must observe the following practices while participating in face-to-face courses and course-related activities (office hours, help sessions, transitioning to andbetween classes, study spaces, academic services, etc.):• Self-monitoring—Students should follow CDC recommendations for self-monitoring. Studentswho have a fever or exhibit symptoms of COVID-19 should participate in class remotelyif that option is available, and should not participate in face-to-face instruction.• Face Coverings—Face coverings  (https://rules-saps.tamu.edu/PDFs/34.99.99.M0.03.pdf)(cloth face covering, surgical mask, etc.) must be properly worn in all non-private spacesincluding classrooms, teaching laboratories, common spaces such as lobbies and hallways,public study spaces, libraries, academic resource and support offices, and outdoor spaceswhere 6 feet of physical distancing is difficult to reliably maintain. Description of face coveringsand additional guidance are provided in the Face Covering policy (https://rules-saps.tamu.edu/PDFs/34.99.99.M0.03.pdf) and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)(https://provost.tamu.edu/Menu/News/TAMU-Face-Covering-FAQs) available on the Provostwebsite (https://provost.tamu.edu/Menu/News/TAMU-Face-Covering-FAQs) .  • Physical Distancing—Physical distancing must be maintained between students, instructors,and others in course and course-related activities.• Classroom Ingress/Egress—Students must follow marked pathways for entering and exitingclassrooms and other teaching spaces. Leave classrooms promptly after course activities haveconcluded. Do not congregate in hallways and maintain 6-foot physical distancing whenwaiting to enter classrooms and other instructional spaces.• To attend a face-to-face class, students must properly wear an approved face covering. If astudent refuses to wear a face covering, the instructor should ask the student to leave and jointhe class remotely. If the student does not leave the class, the faculty member should reportthat student to the Student Conduct office (https://studentlife.tamu.edu/sco/face-covering-violations/) for sanctions. Additionally, the faculty member may choose to teach that day’sclass remotely for all students, or dismiss the class in the case of a traditional face to facelecture.Personal Illness and QuarantineStudents required to quarantine must participate in courses and course-related activities remotely,if that option is available, and must not attend face-to-face course activities. Students shouldnotify their instructors of the quarantine requirement.  Students under quarantine are expected toparticipate in courses and complete graded work unless they have symptoms that are too severeto participate in course activities.  Students required to quarantine must also complete the COVID-19 Form(https://redcap.tamhsc.edu/surveys/?s=N38DRD4EMK) (please select "Self" when asked who ismaking the report) and follow the guidance for sick/exposed campus members(https://www.tamu.edu/coronavirus/sick-campus-members/) provided by the University.  Students experiencing personal injury or Illness that is too severe for the student to attend classqualify for an excused absence (See Student Rule 7, Section 7.2.2 (https://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07/) .)
