Grading Policy
1. 4 assignments (each includes written and programming components), 12% each = 48%.
Late policy: 1 point (out of 100 point total) deduction per hour (24/100 per day).
All submissions should be done as colab notebooks. Download the ipynb file and submit it to
Canvas.
After completing each problem in the homework, "pin" the revision.
As a separate file, submit the revision logs (turn of f "Output", compare current pin with
immediate previous pin).
Hand-written notes may be included in the notebook (scan or photo).
If you are using a local Jupyter notebook install, submit your history (run the following
command)

Exam will be conducted on Canvas  in class, in-person.
3. Attendance: 6%
1% deduction per unexcused absence (see T AMU student rules for excusable absences). Per
university rule, only one interview is excusable. Y ou should schedule your interview to avoid9/15/22, 3:44 PM Syllabus for 22 SPRING CSCE 421 MACHINE LEARNING (Sections 200/500)
https://canvas.tamu.edu/courses/137553/assignments/syllabus 4/11the fixed midterm and final dates.
Forged signatures will lead to 'F'. Use a consistent style. Do not use initials. 
 
Late Work Policy
Late penalty: 1 point (out of 100) per hour . Late submissions will not be accepted 4 days after the
deadline and/or after the solution has been posted.
 
Local Course Policy
All work should be done  individually  and on your own .
If you find solutions to homeworks or programming assignments on the web (or in a book, etc.),
check with the instructor first to determine if you can use it or not.
Assignments turned in that are significantly similar will be reported to the Aggie Honor System Of fice.
There will be no make up exams  unless it is due to a genuine emergency defined by university
rules. Examples of events that  do not  count as an emergency include the following: (1) Merely
visiting the doctor's of fice without an explicit note from the of fice requesting absence. (2) Interview
trips that got scheduled at the last moment, etc. Note that this is not an exhaustive list. All make up
exams, if given, will be dif ferent from the original exam. Instructor may choose to give an oral exam
instead of a written exam.

University Policies
This section outlines the university level policies. The T AMU Faculty Senate established the wording of
these policies.
[NOTE : Faculty members should not change the written statements. A faculty member may add
separate paragraphs if additional information is needed.]
Attendance Policy
The university views class attendance and participation as an individual student responsibility . Students
are expected to attend class and to complete all assignments.
Please refer to  Student Rule 7  (https://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07/)  in its entirety for information
about excused absences, including definitions, and related documentation and timelines.
 
Makeup Work Policy
Students will be excused from attending class on the day of a graded activity or when attendance
contributes to a student’ s grade, for the reasons stated in Student Rule 7, or other reason deemed
appropriate by the instructor .
Please refer to  Student Rule 7  (https://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07/)  in its entirety for information
about makeup work, including definitions, and related documentation and timelines.
Absences related to T itle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 may necessitate a period of more
than 30 days for make-up work, and the timeframe for make-up work should be agreed upon by the9/15/22, 3:44 PM Syllabus for 22 SPRING CSCE 421 MACHINE LEARNING (Sections 200/500)

“The instructor is under no obligation to provide an opportunity for the student to make up work missed
because of an unexcused absence”  (Student Rule 7, Section 7.4.2  (https://student-
rules.tamu.edu/rule07/) ).
Students who request an excused absence are expected to uphold the Aggie Honor Code and Student
Conduct Code.  (See Student Rule 24  (https://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule24/) ).
 
Academic Integrity Statement and Policy
“An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal, or tolerate those who do.”
“Texas A&M University students are responsible for authenticating all work submitted to an instructor . If
asked, students must be able to produce proof that the item submitted is indeed the work of that student.
Students must keep appropriate records at all times. The inability to authenticate one’ s work, should the
instructor request it, may be suf ficient grounds to initiate an academic misconduct case” ( Section
20.1.2.3, Student Rule 20  (https://aggiehonor.tamu.edu/Rules-and-Procedures/Rules/Honor-System-
Rules) ).

Title IX and Statement on Limits to Conﬁdentiality
Texas A&M University is committed to fostering a learning environment that is safe and productive for all.
University policies and federal and state laws prohibit gender-based discrimination and sexual
harassment, including sexual assault, sexual exploitation, domestic violence, dating violence, and
stalking.
With the exception of some medical and mental health providers, all university employees (including full
and part-time faculty , staf f, paid graduate assistants, student workers, etc.) are Mandatory Reporters and
must report to the T itle IX Of fice if the employee experiences, observes, or becomes aware of an
incident that meets the following conditions  (see University Rule 08.01.01.M1  (https://rules-
saps.tamu.edu/PDFs/08.01.01.M1.pdf) ):
The incident is reasonably believed to be discrimination or harassment.
The incident is alleged to have been committed by or against a person who, at the time of the
incident, was (1) a student enrolled at the University or (2) an employee of the University .
Mandatory Reporters must file a report regardless of how the information comes to their attention –
including but not limited to face-to-face conversations, a written class assignment or paper , class
discussion, email, text, or social media post. Although Mandatory Reporters must file a report, in most
instances, a person who is subjected to the alleged conduct will be able to control how the report is
handled, including whether or not to pursue a formal investigation. The University’ s goal is to make sure
you are aware of the range of options available to you and to ensure access to the resources you need.
