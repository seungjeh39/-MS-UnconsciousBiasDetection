Weiss, 2014,Pearson, ISBN-13: 978-0132847377 or ISBN-10: 013284737X. Also, you may need a textbook on C++language from the previous semester, or any good C++ reference book(s).• Required: A computer with a web camera. A computer that you need to use during the labs and lectures totake in-class quizzes and tests.• Required: Web, Zoom, and Canvas access. The course material, assignments turn-in, and posting gradesare handled through Canvas. The recommended browsers to access Canvas are Mozilla Firefox and GoogleChrome.Grading PolicyGrading Scale90–100A80–89.9B70–79.9C60–69.9D0–59.9F• Your ﬁnal grade will be determined based on written homework, programming assignments, cultural assignment,quizzes, and exams.• The assignment handout will provide points distribution. Each programming assignment will be graded focusedon: algorithm design, usage of data structures and/or new user-deﬁned types and their implementation, itscorrectness, tests, a typed report describing implemented algorithms and data structures, and results ofcomputational experiments.• All grade appeals must be made no later than one week after the grade is posted.Graded Attendance• The students lab attendance is required and will be taken on regular basis.• The lecture attendance will be taken by pop quizzes. The students are responsible to learn all material coveredin class, read the assigned text from the textbook and do homework assignments.• The 2 bonus points will be added to your ﬁnal score if you have a perfect lab attendance, or 1 point if you haveonly one lab absence.• Make-up exams and quizzes will only be given with documented University-approved excuses, see UniversityRegulations (http://student-rules.tamu.edu/) . The student Rule 7 (http://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07)  explainspolicies and excused absences. Please discuss unusual circumstances in advance with the instructor.Notes about graded materialsSyllabus for 22 SPRING CSCE 221 LEYK: DATA STRUC & ALGOR...https://canvas.tamu.edu/courses/136654/assignments/syllabus
2 of 812/29/21, 6:37 PM• All homework assignments will be announced in class and posted on Canvas. See the link to the coursecalendar on Canvas for deadlines.• The written part of homework assignments or programming reports, and the Cover Page should be typedpreferably using LaTeX, overleaf.com (an online LaTeX text editor), or LyX (document processor based onLaTeX), see the class webpage for a tutorial. The homework (in PDF format) should be submitted to Canvas orGradescope.• All programming assignments should be implemented in C++ and transferred to Canvas or/and Gradeskope forgrading.• Culture assignments allow you to explore the latest developments in Computer Science and Engineering orlearn about the famous computer scientists like Turing Award winners. The homework should be submitted toCanvas or/and Gradescope.• Quizzes are over material covered during the lectures and assigned reading from the textbook.• The Instructor and TAs can request oral exam to check student’s knowledge over material covered by test orassignment.Late Work PolicyA late homework assignment will be accepted up to 1 day with a 5% penalty. Once solutions have been discussedor handed out the assignments will not be accepted. Please discuss unusual circumstances in advance with theinstructor. Work submitted by a student as makeup work for an excused absence is not considered late work and isexempted from the late work policy.

Programming is not something you can learn overnight by reading atextbook or lecture notes; it requires a lot of practice. The TAs assigned and I are willing to help you to learn andSyllabus for 22 SPRING CSCE 221 LEYK: DATA STRUC & ALGOR...https://canvas.tamu.edu/courses/136654/assignments/syllabus
5 of 812/29/21, 6:37 PMunderstand the course material, and help you to master your programming skills so please see us during ourofﬁce hours. A few hints about how to succeed in this course:◦ attend class and lab meetings regularly◦ read lecture notes and related material in the textbook, and feel free to ask questions◦ study for quizzes and tests◦ retype and implement in C++ examples from the lecture notes and textbook◦ complete all labs and projects◦ if you have any course related questions please visit us during our ofﬁce hours◦ use the online Campuswire to ask questions and participate in discussionsIn general, Computer Science is not an easy subject but it will pay off after graduation.University PoliciesAttendance PolicyThe university views class attendance and participation as an individual student responsibility. Students areexpected to attend class and to complete all assignments.Please refer to Student Rule 7 (https://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07/) in its entirety for information about excusedabsences, including deﬁnitions, and related documentation and timelines.Makeup Work PolicyStudents will be excused from attending class on the day of a graded activity or when attendance contributes to astudent’s grade, for the reasons stated in Student Rule 7, or other reason deemed appropriate by the instructor.Please refer to Student Rule 7 (https://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07/) in its entirety for information about makeupwork, including deﬁnitions, and related documentation and timelines.Absences related to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 may necessitate a period of more than 30 daysfor make-up work, and the timeframe for make-up work should be agreed upon by the student and instructor”(Student Rule 7, Section 7.4.1 (https://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07/) ).“The instructor is under no obligation to provide an opportunity for the student to make up work missed because ofan unexcused absence” (Student Rule 7, Section 7.4.2 (https://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07/) ).Students who request an excused absence are expected to uphold the Aggie Honor Code and Student ConductCode. (See Student Rule 24 (https://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule24/) .)Academic Integrity Statement and Policy“An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal, or tolerate those who do.”“Texas A&M University students are responsible for authenticating all work submitted to an instructor. If asked,students must be able to produce proof that the item submitted is indeed the work of that student. Students mustkeep appropriate records at all times. The inability to authenticate one’s work, should the instructor request it, maybe sufﬁcient grounds to initiate an academic misconduct case” (Section 20.1.2.3, Student Rule 20(https://aggiehonor.tamu.edu/Rules-and-Procedures/Rules/Honor-System-Rules) ).Syllabus for 22 SPRING CSCE 221 LEYK: DATA STRUC & ALGOR...https://canvas.tamu.edu/courses/136654/assignments/syllabus

Although Mandatory Reporters must ﬁle a report, in most instances, you will be able to control how thereport is handled, including whether or not to pursue a formal investigation. The University’s goal is to make sureyou are aware of the range of options available to you and to ensure access to the resources you need.Students wishing to discuss concerns in a conﬁdential setting are encouraged to make an appointment withCounseling and Psychological Services (https://caps.tamu.edu/) (CAPS).Students can learn more about ﬁling a report, accessing supportive resources, and navigating the Title IXinvestigation and resolution process on the University’s Title IX webpage (https://titleix.tamu.edu/) .Statement on Mental Health and WellnessTexas A&M University recognizes that mental health and wellness are critical factors that inﬂuence a student’sacademic success and overall wellbeing. Students are encouraged to engage in healthy self-care by utilizingavailable resources and services on your campusStudents who need someone to talk to can contact Counseling & Psychological Services (CAPS) or call the TAMUHelpline (979-845-2700) from 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. weekdays and 24 hours on weekends. 24-hour emergencySyllabus for 22 SPRING CSCE 221 LEYK: DATA STRUC & ALGOR...https://canvas.tamu.edu/courses/136654/assignments/syllabus
