CSCE
482
is
a
project-oriented
course
aimed
at
developing
system
integration
skills.
Students
work
in
groups
of
3-5
people
to
complete
a
significant
engineering
design
project.
Every
project
requires
complete
implementation,
documentation
and
demonstration
of
a
computing
system
design
with
both
hardware
and
software
components.
The
focus
is
not
only
on
the
final
product
but
also
on
design
methodology, management process and teamwork.
Each
team
will
be
required
to
manage
its
own
efforts
to
complete
its
project
in
a
timely
manner.
Group
members
will
be
required
to
keep
individual
lab
notebooks
recording
their
efforts
and
their
personal
impressions
of
the
project.
Students
will
be
graded
based
on
both
the
quality
of
the
group
product
and
their individual contributions.
Every
team
will
be
required
to
schedule
a
weekly
meeting
with
the
course
instructor
and
the
TA,
preferably
during
the
official
class
or
lab
hours.
These
meetings
must
be
attended
by
every
group
member.
Since
the
projects
will
be
student
managed,
the
exact
nature
and
style
of
these
meetings
is
at
the group’s discretion.
However, every member of the
group is expected to participate
.
At
the
end
of
the
semester,
each
group
will
make
a
public
presentation
describing
and
demonstrating
their work. These presentations will be open to the university community.
Course objectives
To
prepare
students
for
engineering
practice
with
a
major
design
experience
based
on
the
knowledge
and
skills
acquired
in
earlier
course
work
and
incorporating
engineering
standards
and
realistic
constraints
that
include
most
of
the
following
considerations:
economic;
environmental;
sustainability;
manufacturability; ethical; health and safety; social; and political.
Expected outcomes
It is expected that successful participation in the course will allow the student to demonstrate:
●
Analyze a complex computing problem and to apply principles of computing and other
relevant disciplines to identify solutions.
●
Design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of
computing requirements in the context of the program’ s discipline.
●
Communicate ef fectively in a variety of professional contexts.
●
Recognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgments in computing
practice based on legal and ethical principles.
●
Function ef fectively as a member or leader of a team engaged in activities appropriate to
the program’ s discipline.
●
Apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce
computing-based solutions.
Grading Policy
The
final
grade
you
will
receive
in
the
class
will
be
based
on
points
accumulated
during
the
semester.
Thus,
both
continued
progress
(the
process)
and
the
quality
of
your
product
(and
other
deliverables)
will
determine
your
grade.
Although
the
bulk
of
your
grade
is
based
on
the
performance
of
your
team,
individual performance will also be gauged.1.
Project Proposal (5%)
: These points will be based on (1) the originality, creativity and feasibility
of the proposed work, the analysis of alternative solutions, the consideration of economic and
societal aspects, the project management approach (3%), and (2) the quality of the oral
presentation (2%).
A template for the proposal report
and a presentation rubric are available on
the course webpage.
2.
Critical Design Review (10%)
: The CDR is a mid-semester
evaluation of your project. The
grade will be based on your progress to date, and the quality of the oral presentation and
accompanying written report.
A template for the CDR
report and a presentation rubric are
available on the course webpage
.
3.
Final Communication (15%):
This grade will be based
on the quality of the final presentation
(5%), as well as the contents and professional finish of the documentation (10%).
A template for
the final report and a presentation rubric are available on the course webpage.
4.
Weekly Progress (10%):
This grade will be based on
your team’s ability to maintain the project
on schedule. The weekly report should be
incremental
,
and should specifically address the
following:
 
a.
Agenda
for the weekly meeting with the instructor
and the TA
 
b.  Any major accomplishments
during this time period
,
including figures and results
 
c.  An overview of the
plan of work
for the following
two weeks
 
d.  An update on project management, including teamwork, purchases, schedule and milestone
status
 
e.
Minutes
of the previous meeting
Weekly
progress
reports
are
due
two
hours
prior
to
the
time
of
the
weekly
meeting.
The
responsibility
of
preparing
these
reports
will
be
rotated
among
team
members.
The
team
member
preparing
the
report
will
also
be
in
charge
of
facilitating
the
discussions
during
that
weekly
meeting,
and
preparing
an
action
list
for
the
following
week.
The
action
list
contains
the
set
of
specific
goals
that each team member has agreed to complete AND a deadline for completing them.
5.
Project Grade (20%):
A final grade will be assigned
to your project based on the completion of
all the objectives stated in the proposal, as well as on a live demonstration in front of the class.
The complexity of your project and the size of your team will be factored in. Due date: Project
demonstrations will take place 48 hours prior to the final presentation (or the Friday prior if on a
weekend). This earlier deadline for the demo ensures that teams have time to prepare the final
communication and final presentation.
For items 1-5: using GitHub sites for your group and grading purposes:
I.
Teams will use the TAMU Enterprise GitHub (https://github.tamu.edu/) to organize and trace
course progress and materials. All required group materials such as project proposal, weekly
report, CDR, final report and presentation files, should be shared on the TAMU GitHub. The
activity log there will be used to assess how each individual contributed to the team as well.
II.
Teams should make use of GitHub features such as the README, issues, Wiki, etc,  in order to
provide documentation for their project.6.
Teamwork (10%):
It is very important to understand that accomplishing the technical objectives
of the project is not sufficient. These accomplishments should not come at the expense of
destroying relationships among team members. Thus, a grade will be assigned based on the
ability of the group to function as a team.  Is there evidence that the group engaged in team
building activities? Were contributions to the project evenly distributed? Were members equally
engaged in discussions during meetings?  Was there an effective division of responsibilities?
Among the 10%:
i.
2% is given to the teamwork quiz and
ii.
8% is determined by final evaluation of teamwork effectiveness.
The project grade is a direct outcome of teamwork. Teamwork grade level cannot be higher than
project grade.
Individua
l
Performance (30%):
Points in this category
are awarded based on assessments of your
personal contribution to the team efforts:
a.
Notebook
(5%):
You
are
required
to
record
what
YOU
do
as
a
member
of
the
project.
Entries
in
the
notebook
should
be
made
during
or
shortly
after
every
work
session.
Each
entry
should
include
(1)
the
date,
(2)
the
objectives
for
that
session,
and
(3)
record
of
what
was
done.
A
grade
will
be
assigned to your personal design notebook based on:
i.
The regularity of your entries throughout the semester.
ii.
The evidence of an engineering design process, including but not limited to schematics, block
diagrams, circuits, pseudo-code, tables of experimental results, and mathematical derivations.
iii.
The clarity, legibility and organization of your annotations.
You
can
choose
either
paper-based
notebook
or
electronic-based
notebook:
Paper-based
notebooks
must
have
permanent
binding
(i.e.,
composition
pads);
spiral-bound
notebooks
will
not
be
accepted,
failing
to
do
so
will
result
in
a
5%
penalty
on
the
final
grade.
Electronic
notebook
can
be
either
word
file
or
pdf
file.
The
file
should
clearly
contain
aforementioned
materials
in
an
organized
manner.
The file should be cumulative which contains all the information since the beginning of the class.
 
b.
Participation (4%):
The instructor and TA will
evaluate your attendance to meetings, participation in
the discussions, and contributions to the team. Team leaders will instead be evaluated by their ability to
make the group operate as a team, i.e., item (6) above.
 
 
c.
Peer Review (9%):
Your performance will be evaluated
by each of your team members throughout the
semester. There are three peer reviews throughout the semester.
 
 
d.
GitHub Insights (10%):
All projects will be hosted
on TAMU’s Enterprise GitHub (github.tamu.edu).
 
All project code should be managed, from the project beginning, in this system. Through proper
 
version control techniques, your individual work history on the project will be documented. You
 
will be required to maintain a stable main project branch by implementing features on separate
 
working branches and creating pull requests for the entire team to review and merge into the
 
main branch. You will be assigned a grade for your GitHub contributions based on:
 
i.
(3%) The regularity of your commit history throughout the semester. For example, if you only
commit code at the last week of semester, you will lose the three points.
ii.
(4%) The quality and quantity of code and documentation you committed to the project
throughout the semester. Note: Code quality including metrics such as structure, readability, andefficiency will be weighted more heavily than the number of lines of code committed.
iii.
(4%) Adherence to good version control practices such as using branches to develop new
features without affecting the main branch, avoiding bundling unrelated changes into single
commits, and writing good commit messages.
e.
Online course about ethics (2%)
: We will provide
an online ethics course in Canvas.
NOTE
:
Grades
will
not
be
assigned
until
all
project
deliverables
have
been
turned
in
(see
below),
all
borrowed
items
(e.g.,
keys,
books,
equipment)
have
been
returned
to
their
proper
location
or
their
owner,
and
the
workstations
in
the
lab
have
been
thoroughly
cleaned
up.
All
team
members
are
required
to be present at the time of the final delivery unless due to excused absence allowed by Student rule 7.
