Course Learning Outcomes
This course primarily aims at providing a level of literacy in information security adequate enough to
understand the security implications on a number of diverse domains including software engineering;
networking; privacy; and policy . 
A secondary objective is to provide a working knowledge of topics such as cryptography , privacy ,
network security , and infrastructure management, so that students can acquire the necessary
background for more advanced security courses. 
By the end of this course, students will be able to reason about systems from the perspective of a
security engineer . That is, they should be able to deﬁne the system to protect; determine the security
properties that are desired for this system; identify the possible threats to these security properties,
and their likelihood of occurrence; and consider possible mitigations against these threats.

Grading Policy
Homeworks: 550 points (distributed across 6 homeworks). Y our assignments must be typed and in
PDF format. Submit assignment to gradescope (https://www .gradescope.com)
You are encouraged to discuss concepts with others, but you must do all assignments by yourself
unless specifically instructed otherwise. If you refer to any source while doing your homework, you
must give credit in your solution, (this holds true whether it be a person, paper , book, solution set,
web page or whatever). Y ou MUST write up the assignments in your own words. Never copy
someone else’ s words and turn them in. For example, “the academic integrity policy on this syllabus
was based on one obtained from Prof. Jennifer W elch”, or “Sally Smith walked me through the
solution to #38 and then I did #39 on my own” (assuming #38 was not on the homework).
Midterm exam: 200 points  
Final exam: 250 points1/13/22, 10:29 AM Syllabus: 22 SPRING CSCE 465 501: COMP & NET SECURITY

B = 800-899 points  
C = 700-799 points  
D = 600-699 points  
F = <600 points
We will make an ef fort to complete the grading of work within one week of the turnin date. If you
believe your work was graded incorrectly or incompletely , you must either 1) meet with a T A within
one week of the date the work is returned, or 2) submit a regrade request in Gradescope within one
week (when applicable). Only if you can prove to the T A that your solution is correct and complete
will your work be regraded.
 
Late W ork Policy
Late homeworks are not accepted and are worth 0 points. If you have an extended excused absence
(per rule 7) that prevents you from completing a homework, please coordinate with the professor as
soon as possible for a make-up.
 
Version Control
You are strongly encouraged to use a version control system to track changes and back up your
work. T exas A&M has an institutional GitHub account (https://github.tamu.edu) that you can use. Do
NOT create public repositories containing your assignment solutions as this may lead to
unauthorized copying of your work and a violation of the Aggie Code of Honor .

University Policies
This section outlines the university level policies. The T AMU Faculty Senate established the wording
of these policies.
Attendance Policy
The university views class attendance and participation as an individual student responsibility .

Makeup W ork Policy1/13/22, 10:29 AM Syllabus: 22 SPRING CSCE 465 501: COMP & NET SECURITY
https://canvas.tamu.edu/courses/129614/pages/syllabus 6/8Students will be excused from attending class on the day of a graded activity or when attendance
contributes to a student’ s grade, for the reasons stated in Student Rule 7, or other reason deemed
appropriate by the instructor .
Please refer to Student Rule 7  (https://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07/) in its entirety for information
about makeup work, including definitions, and related documentation and timelines.
Absences related to T itle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 may necessitate a period of more
than 30 days for make-up work, and the timeframe for make-up work should be agreed upon by the
student and instructor” (Student Rule 7, Section 7.4.1  (https://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07/) ).
“The instructor is under no obligation to provide an opportunity for the student to make up work
missed because of an unexcused absence” (Student Rule 7, Section 7.4.2  (https://student-
rules.tamu.edu/rule07/) ).
Students who request an excused absence are expected to uphold the Aggie Honor Code and
Student Conduct Code. (See Student Rule 24  (https://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule24/) ).
 
Academic Integrity Statement and Policy
“An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal, or tolerate those who do.”
“Texas A&M University students are responsible for authenticating all work submitted to an instructor .
If asked, students must be able to produce proof that the item submitted is indeed the work of that
student. Students must keep appropriate records at all times. The inability to authenticate one’ s work,
should the instructor request it, may be suf ficient grounds to initiate an academic misconduct case”

Procedures/Rules/Honor-System-Rules) ).

Title IX and Statement on Limits to Confidentiality
Texas A&M University is committed to fostering a learning environment that is safe and productive for
all. University policies and federal and state laws prohibit gender-based discrimination and sexual
harassment, including sexual assault, sexual exploitation, domestic violence, dating violence, and
stalking.
With the exception of some medical and mental health providers, all university employees (including
full and part-time faculty , staf f, paid graduate assistants, student workers, etc.) are Mandatory
Reporters and must report to the T itle IX Of fice if the employee experiences, observes, or becomes
aware of an incident that meets the following conditions  (see University Rule 08.01.01.M1
(https://rules-saps.tamu.edu/PDFs/08.01.01.M1.pdf) ):
The incident is reasonably believed to be discrimination or harassment.
The incident is alleged to have been committed by or against a person who, at the time of the
incident, was (1) a student enrolled at the University or (2) an employee of the University .
Mandatory Reporters must file a report regardless of how the information comes to their attention –
including but not limited to face-to-face conversations, a written class assignment or paper , class
discussion, email, text, or social media post. Although Mandatory Reporters must file a report, in
most instances, a person who is subjected to the alleged conduct will be able to control how the
report is handled, including whether or not to pursue a formal investigation. The University’ s goal is to
make sure you are aware of the range of options available to you and to ensure access to the
resources you need.
