Detailed Course Description  
CPSC 48 2 is a project -oriented course  aimed at developing system integration skills. Students work in 
groups of 3-5 people to complete a significant engineering design project.  Every project requires 
complete implementation, documentation and demonstration of a computing system design with both 
hardware and software components. The focus is not only on the final product but also on desig n 
methodology, management process and teamwork.  
Each team will be required to manage its own efforts to complete its proje ct in a timely manner. Group 
members will be required to keep individual lab notebooks recording their efforts and their personal 
impressions of the project. Students will be graded based on both the quality of the group product and 
their individual contri butions.   
Every team will be required to schedule a weekly meeting with the course instructor and the TAs, 
preferably during the off icial class or lab hours. These meetings must be attended by every group 
member. Since the projects will be student managed , the exact nature and style of these meetings is at 
the group’s discretion. However, every member of the group is expected to partic ipate .  
At the end of the semester, each group will make a public presentation describing and demonstrating 
their work. The se presentations will be open to the university community.   
 
Course objectives  
To prepare students for engineering practice with a  major design experience based on the knowledge 
and skills acquired in earlier course work and incorporating en gineering standards and realistic 
constraints that include most of the following considerations: economic; environmental; sustainability; 
manufac turability; ethical; health and safety; social; and political.  
 
Expected outcomes  
It is expected that successful participation in the course will allow the student to demonstrate:  
• Analyze a complex computing problem and to apply principles of computing and other 
relevant disciplines to identify solutions.  
• Design, implement, and evaluate a com puting -based solution to meet a given set of 
computing requirements in the context of the program’s discipline.  
• Communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts.  
• Recognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgments in computing  
practice based on legal and ethical principles.  
• Function effectively as a member or leader of a team engaged in activities appropriate to 
the program’s discipline.  
1. Apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce 
computing -based solutions.  
 
Grading Policy  
The final grade you will receive in the class will be based on points accumulated during the semester. 
Thus, both continued progress (the process) and the quality of your product (and other deliverables) will 
determine your grade.  Although the bulk of your grade is based on the performance of your team, 
individual performance will also be gauged.  
 
1  Project Proposal ( 5%): These points will be based on (1) the originality, creativity and 
feasibility of the proposed work, the analysis of alternative solutions, the consideration of economic and societal aspects, the project management approach ( 3%), and (2) the quality of the oral presenta tion 
(2%).  A template for the proposal report and a presentation rubric are available on the course webpage.  
 
3 Critical Design Review (10%) : The CDR is a mid -semester evaluation of your project. The 
grade will be based on your progress to date, and the qu ality of the oral presentation and accompanying 
written report.  A template for the CDR  report and a presentation rubric are available on the course 
webpage .  
 
4 Final Communication (15%):   This grade will be based on the quality of the final presentation 
(5%), as well as the contents and professional finish of the documentation (10%). A template for the 
final report and a presentation rubric are available on the course webpage.  
 
 
2 Weekly P rogress (10%):   This grade will be based on your team’s ability to mai ntain the project 
on schedule. The weekly report should be incremental , and should specifically address the following:  
 
a.  Agenda  for the weekly meeting with the instructor and the TA  
b.  Any major accomplishments during this time period , including figu res and results  
c.  An overview of the plan of work  for the following two weeks  
d.  An update on project management, including teamwork, purchases, schedule and milestone status  
e.  Minutes  of the previous meeting  
 
Weekly progress reports are due two h ours prior to the time of the weekly meeting. The 
responsibility of preparing these reports will be rotated among team members.  The team member 
preparing the report will also be in char ge of facilitating the discussions during that weekly meeting, 
and pre paring an action list  for the following week.  The action list contains the set of specific goals 
that each team member gas agreed to complete AND a deadline for completing them.  
 
 
5 Project Grade (20%):   A final grade will be assigned to your project based  on the completion of 
all the objectives stated in the proposal, as well as on a live demonstration in front of the class.  The 
complexity of your project and the size of your team w ill be factored in. Due date: Project 
demonstrations will take place 48 ho urs prior to the final presentation (or the Friday prior if on a 
weekend). This earlier deadline for the demo ensures that teams have time to prepare the final 
communication and fina l presentation.  
 
For items 1 -5: using GitHub sites for your group and gra ding purposes:  
 
I.Teams will use the TAMU Enterprise GitHub to organize and trace course progress and 
materials. All  
II.required group materials such as project proposal, weekly report, CDR, final report and 
presentation files,  
III.should be shared on the GitHub. A lso, the activity log of the GitHub will be used to access how 
each  
IV.individual contributed to the team as well. Tea ms should make use of GitHub features such as 
the 
V.README and Wiki in order to provide documentation for their project.  
 
 
 
 
6 Teamwork (10 %); It is very important to understand that accomplishing the technical objectives 
of the project is not sufficient. These accomplishments should not come at the expense of destroying 
relationships among team members. Thus, a grade will be assigned based on t he ability of the group to function as a team.  Is there evidence that the group engaged in team building activities? Were 
contributions to the project evenly distributed? Were members equally engaged in discussions during 
meetings?  Was there an effective  division of responsibilities? The project grade is direct outcome of 
teamwork. Teamwork score is no more than the project grade in 5. Among the 10%,  
 
I. 2% is given to the teamwork quiz and  
II. 8% is determined by final evaluation of teamwork effectiveness.  Teamwork grade level cannot 
be higher than project grade.  
 
 
7  Individua l Performance (30%):   Points in this category are awarded based on assessments 
of your personal contribution to the team efforts:  
 
a. Notebook ( 5%): You are required to record what YOU do  as a member of the project.  Entries in the 
notebook should be made during or shortly after every work session.  Each entry should include (1) 
the date, (2) the objectives for that session, and (3) record of what was  done. A grade will be 
assigned to your  personal design notebook based on:  
   i.  The regularity of your entries throughout the semester.  
   ii.  The evidence of an engineering design process, including but not limited to schematics, block 
diagrams, circ uits, pseudo -code, tables of experiment al results, and mathematical derivations.  
   iii. The clarity, legibility and organization of your annotations.   
 
   You can choose either paper -based notebook or electronic -based notebook:  Paper -based 
notebooks must have permanent binding (i.e., composi tion pads); spiral -bound notebooks will not be 
accepted , failing to do so will result in a 5% penalty on the final grade. Electronic notebook can be either 
word file or pdf file. The file should clearly co ntain aforementioned materials in an organized mann er. 
The file should be cumulative which contain s all the information from the beginning of the class.   
 
b. Participation ( 4%):  The instructor and TA will evaluate your attendance to meetings,    
 participation in the discussions, and contributions to the team. Team leaders will instead  
 be evaluated by their ability to make the group operate as a team, i.e., item (6) above.  
 
c. Peer Review ( 9%): Your performance will be evaluated by each of your team members   
 throughout the semester.  There are three pe er reviews throughout the semester.  
  
d. GitHub Insights (10%):  All projects will be hosted on TAMU’s Enterprise GitHub (github.t amu.edu).  
All project code should be managed, from the project beginning, in this system. Through proper  
version control techn iques, your individual work history on the project will be documented. You  
will be required to maintain a stable master project b ranch by implementing features on separate  
working branches and creating pull requests for the entire team to review and merge into the  
master branch.  You will be assigned a grade for your GitHub contributions based on:  
 
i. (3%) The regularity of your commit history throughout the semester.  For example, if you only 
submit codes at the last week of semester, you will lose the three po ints. 
ii. (4%) The quality and quantity of code  and documentation  you committed to the project 
throughout the semester. Note: Code quality including metrics such as structure,  readability, and 
efficiency will be weighted more heavily than the number of  lines o f code committed.  
iii. (4%) Adherence to good version control prac tices such as using branches to  develop new 
features without affecting the master branch, avoiding  bundling unrelated changes into single 
commits, and writing good commit  messages.  
 
e. Online cou rse about ethics (2%) : We will provide an online ethics  cours e in canvass.  
  
f. AutoDrive Challenge Participation Extra Credit (max 5%):  All projects this semester are facilitated  
through the Texas A&M Unmanned Team as part of the GM/SAE AutoDrive Challen ge. 
Throughout the semester, there may be opportunities to contribute to the team beyond what is  
required as part of the course requirements e.g. preparing or presenting team reports for the  
AutoDrive competition. Students may be offered extra credit for v olunteering for such tasks in  
proportion t o the effort required.  
 
 
NOTE : Grades will not be assigned until all project deliverables have been turned in (see below), all 
borrowed items (e.g., keys, books, equipment) have been returned to their proper locati on or their owner, 
and the workstations in the lab  have been thoroughly  cleaned up. All team members are required to be 
present at the time of the final delivery  unless due to excused absence allowed by Student rule 7.   
 
 
Final deliverables  
 
1) Final doc umentation and project materials in  electronic zip file with name as 
team_name_ project_report.zip under the google site of the project. It should include a plain text 
readme file that documents the list of contents. The detailed materials should includ e the following 
(please organize into folders, e.g., Docs, Sour ce, Hardware, Media, References, Freeware , Videos )  
 a)  Designs: code, schematics, data, data sheets, freeware software tools, etc.  
 b)  Reports: proposal, CDR, weekly reports, final report, and ALL presentations  
c)  Audiovisual media: close -up pictures of your system *AND* a high-quality  movie demo of the 
system working, for posterity .  
3) Final hardware prototype, as well as any spare parts and supplies  
4) Software install,  to be demonstrated on several machines  
5) Peer reviews  
6) Notebooks  
 
Final reports should have a discussion of constraints that the team had to satisf y (e.g., cost, time, 
technology limitations) and of relevant industry standards used (e.g., coding, interfaces, safety).  
 
Document preparation  
 
All major documents (proposal, CDR, and final documentation) should be submitted in a professional 
format (e.g., spiral -binding), and should contain a title page, an outline, as well as clear section and 
subsection headings, etc.  Pl ease run a spell check before submitting.
