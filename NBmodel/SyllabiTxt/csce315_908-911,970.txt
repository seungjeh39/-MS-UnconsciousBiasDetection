Programming Studio
It is estimated that Windows XP has 50,000,000 lines of code. The average mobile phone has over
10 million lines of code. The average developer writes 10 – 20 useful lines of code per day , so a
couple of engineers and 2 friends could break away , start a new company , and create a new
“Windows” operating system in only about  1700 years . That’ s not reasonable.
Up until now , most of the programs that you have been asked to write could probably fit in your mind.
When you complete the letter , you fold it, seal it up, and mail it of f (or hit send). But now it is plain to
see that products that you use daily simply could not be recreated by you and 10 of your best friends
in an afternoon, weekend, or semester . A 1700-year project is wildly unreasonable. There must be a
better way .
In this course, you will learn a better way . You will dive into the world of software engineering and
hone your teamwork (and, yes, coding) skills. Ef fective teamwork is essential, and software design
methodologies make development more ef ficient. This course gives you very practical skills for being
an ef fective member of a development team and producing high-quality , sustainable software.
Learning these methods of working together , managing requirements, producing quality software
products, and testing, delivering, and maintaining these products is every bit as valuable as coding.
 
Why I Teach this Course
This course is of fers you a unique learning experience. I am always especially excited to teach this
course, and here is why:
Building software is fun and rewarding  
You get many opportunities to “learn by doing”
There’ s more to software than just coding  
You get a taste of software engineering
Working on teams can be messy , but it’ s worth it  
It is amazing what you can accomplish together , so much more than on your own

Grading Policy
Grading Components:
Your grade for this course reflects your mastery of course material and is determined by multiple
components. As a writing course,  you must pass the writing components with a C or better to
earn a grade in the course. Failure to pass the writing components with a C or better results in an F
for the course.1/17/22, 4:30 PM Syllabus: 22 SPRING CSCE 315 908-91 1,970: PROGRAMMING STUDIO
https://canvas.tamu.edu/courses/136192/pages/syllabus 5/11Team Projects – 40%:  Two major projects, each worth 20% of the course grade, for 40% total.
Specific grading practices for each project will be announced when that project is given out. Y our
individual contribution determined from logged code commits, peer evaluation, and instructor/T A
observations will be a significant contributing factor to these project grades.
Individual Project – 5%: The individual project will be completed prior to the team projects. Specific
grading practices will be announced when the assignment is given out.
Written Elements – 35%: This is a writing intensive course. Y ou are required to pass this component
with a C or better to earn a grade in the course. Y ou will have several written assignments within the
projects (roughly 10% from the individual project, 12% from the first team project, and 13% from the
second team project). Specific grading practices will be announced when each assignment is given
out.
Other Course Activities – 20%:  The course has several dif ferent types of activities to help you
better understand concepts and connect with the material. This includes (but is not limited to) at-
home activities, in-class activities, and lab activities. These activities bring deeper , longer-term
learning as you work, either individually or with other students. For submitted assignments, grading
will be based on the quality of the submitted work. For group assignments, your full participation
is required to receive a grade for that assignment . This component will be divided as follows: 10%
in-class activities (lowest grade dropped), 5% lab activities (lowest grade dropped), 3% at-home
activities, and 2% in-class knowledge checks (lowest two grades dropped).
Grading Scale:
Grades will be assigned according to the following scale: A >= 90 > B >= 80 > C >= 70 > D >= 60 > F
These grades represent varying degrees of achievement (see the university's grading system
(https://registrar.tamu.edu/Transcripts-Grades/Grades#0-GradingSystem) ): A = excellent, B = good, C
= satisfactory , D = passing, F = failing
Stacked Honors Section:
The stacked honors section will explore course concepts more deeply through readings, discussions,
reflections, and projects. They will have honors-only lecture sessions on the first Friday of each
month.
Submission of Assignments:
All assignments will be turned in electronically though Canvas  (https://canvas.tamu.edu/) (unless
otherwise specified) by the due date and time given on the assignment. Email submissions will not be
accepted.

https://canvas.tamu.edu/courses/136192/pages/syllabus 9/11Bring Your Own Device Policy
BYOD is an initiative in the College of Engineering where students are required bring their own
computing device to lecture and lab . You need to have a computing device with a headset,
microphone, and webcam. Y ou will also need stable internet access outside of lecture and lab. See
the BYOD webpage  (https://engineering.tamu.edu/easa/areas/academics/byod) for information on
the program, approved devices, and financial assistance. BYOD devices fulfill the requirements for
this class.
 
Academic Integrity Statement and Policy
“An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal, or tolerate those who do.”
“Texas A&M University students are responsible for authenticating all work submitted to an instructor .
If asked, students must be able to produce proof that the item submitted is indeed the work of that
student. Students must keep appropriate records at all times. The inability to authenticate one’ s work,
should the instructor request it, may be suf ficient grounds to initiate an academic misconduct case”
(Section 20.1.2.3, Student Rule 20  (https://aggiehonor.tamu.edu/Rules-and-
Procedures/Rules/Honor-System-Rules) ).
You can learn more about the Aggie Honor System Of fice Rules and Procedures, academic integrity ,
and your rights and responsibilities at aggiehonor .tamu.edu  (https://aggiehonor.tamu.edu/) .
All suspected academic misconduct is taken seriously and will be reported to the Aggie Honor
System Of fice.
For this class, certain aspects of the honor code need to be clarified:
1. External code/software/libraries:  There will be times in this course where you or your team
make use of external code/software/libraries. Whenever this is done, you must make sure that
you: follow any licensing and/or use restrictions that library/code requires and clearly document
what the source of the external code was, and how it was used. Failure to follow licensing or
usage restrictions or neglecting to clearly document usage is an honor code violation.
2. Outside assistance:  There may be times in this course where you or your team would like to
seek outside assistance related to projects and assignments. Any assistance from any person
other than members of your team, the instructor , teaching assistants, or peer teachers  needs
prior approval from the instructor  and needs to be clearly documented. This also includes
online websites and material. Do not assume that if you have access to something that it is
approved.  Using unapproved outside assistance of any kind is an honor code violation.  
3. Working in teams:  You will be working in team environments in this course, and your work as a
team will be used to determine grades. As such, it is your responsibility , when asked, to:
Accurately describe the work that you have done on a team project.  Claiming credit for
work that you have not done or that others did instead is an honor code violation.1/17/22, 4:30 PM Syllabus: 22 SPRING CSCE 315 908-91 1,970: PROGRAMMING STUDIO
https://canvas.tamu.edu/courses/136192/pages/syllabus 10/11Accurately describe (to the best of your knowledge) the performance of other team
members.  “Covering” for another team member (claiming they did more work than you know
they did, or exaggerating the work they did) or “spiking” them (claiming they did less work than
you know they did, or purposefully minimizing the work they did) are examples of honor code
violations.
Prevent (as best you can) or report (known or suspected) violations of the honor code
by your other team members.  You share responsibility when a project is turned in; if you are
aware of a teammate having violated the code in his/her work on the project, and do not report
it, you are claiming credit for that violation yourself .
If there are any questions or concerns about whether an action is appropriate, you should check with
the instructor or teaching assistant first.  If in doubt, assume that the action is not appropriate.
 
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Policy
Texas A&M University is committed to providing equitable access to learning opportunities for all
students. If you experience barriers to your education due to a disability or think you may have a
disability , please contact Disability Resources of fice on your campus (resources listed below).
Disabilities may include, but are not limited to attentional, learning, mental health, sensory , physical,
or chronic health conditions. All students are encouraged to discuss their disability related needs with
Disability Resources and their instructors as soon as possible.
Disability Resources is located in the Student Services Building or at (979) 845-1637 or visit
