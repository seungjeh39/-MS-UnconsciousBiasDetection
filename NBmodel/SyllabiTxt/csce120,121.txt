Diversity Equity and Inclusion 
Accessibility Statements 
Michael Moore's Accessibility Statement 
While the new Disability Accommodation Portal (AIM Portal)  will ease sharing accommodation information, you must still 
make an appointment with me to discuss your accommodations. In addition to accommodations, I can help you develop strategies to become successful in this course. 
Prior to being a professor, I worked as a certified sign language interpreter in the state of Texas while getting my MS and PhD degrees in computer science. I have a great interest in providing an environment where students with disabilities can thrive. I wish I could accommodate anyone for any need. However, the university requires that I only provide accommodations for students registered with Disability Resources
. I’m always fascinated with the rich tapestry of diversity 
which make up my classes. In fact, I teach a course on Accessible Computing which focuses on principles for  creating accessible applications and programs. 
“I’d prefer that you get your accommodations and not need them, rather than trying without your accommodations and finding out that you neede d them.” Earlier in my career I noticed a disturbing pattern. Student s would try to get through the first exam without using their accommodations. I suspect this was due to negative experiences with prior  instructors. Frequently, they said they just wanted to try it without the accommodation. After the first exam, there would be a rush of students submitting their accommodation letters. These instances have greatly decreased since I’ve been explicit about my preferences.  
Philip Ritchey's Accessibility Statement 
I recognize disability as an aspect of diversity, equity, and inclusion.  For that reason, I try to design all of my course material to be inclusive and accessible.  However, I realize that some aspects of the course may not yet be as inclusive as they could be.  I rely in part on my students to let me know when and where they need some accommodation.  I want you to know that my top priority is for my students to learn as much as they can in my class.  That includes working with students to find solutions that help them perform at their best.  I hope tools like the Disability Accommodation Portal will make it easier for students to start the conversation about how we can work together to help them make the most out of their learning opportunities. 
Paul Taele's Accessibility Statement 
Your experience in this class is important to me. It is the policy and practice of Texas A&M University to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law. If you have already established accommodations with Disability Resources, please activate your accommodations via AIM Portal (
click here to access the AIM PortalLinks to an 
external site. ) so we can discuss how they will be implemented in this course.  
If you have not yet established services through Disability Resources, but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations (conditions include but not limited to; mental health, attention- related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health impacts), contact Disability Resources directly to set up an accessibility plan. Disability 4 of 13   Resources facilitates the interactive process that establishes reasonable accommodations.  Click here for Disability 
Resources's website.Links to an external site.  
Brennen Taylor's Accessibility Statement 
Inclusivity is important to me, and I commit to making all course materials as accessible as I can. Part of this includes support for students with disabilities. In addition to being required by campus policy, I have personally worked with students whose utilization of the resources available to them has helped them achieve greater success in their completion of the course.  Please activate your accommodations in the new Disability Accommodation Portal (AIM Portal)
 . In addition, at the very least, 
shoot me an email and make we aware of your accommodations so I can be aware and work with you.  I would also be happy to meet with any student and discuss their accommodations if you prefer that  as well. 
Preferred Name and Preferred Gender Pronouns 
Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, culture, religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender, gender variance, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records.  
Non-Discrimination Policy 
Texas A&M is committed to the fundamental principles of academic freedom, equality of opportunity and human dignity.  To fulfill its multiple missions as an institution of higher learning, Texas A&M encourages a climate that values and nurtures collegiality, diversity, pluralism and the uniqueness of the individual  within our state, nation and world.  All decisions and actions involving students and employees should be based on applicable law and individual merit.  Texas A&M University prohibits students, employees, and third parties from engaging in discrimination and/or harassment on the basis of race, color, sex, gender identity, age, religion, disability, national origin, sexual orientation, genetic infor mation, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state, or local law. In addition, act ing in complicity with another who engages in any of these forms of prohibited conduct, or retaliating against a person who participates in protected activity, is also prohibited.  Harassment of a student in class, i.e., a pattern of behavior directed agai nst a particular student with the intent of humiliating or intimidating that student will not be tolerated.  The mere expression of one’s ideas is not harassment and is fully protected by academic freedom, but personal harassment of individual students is not permitted.  
Professionalism and Respect 
You are expected to treat your instructor and all other participants in the course with courtesy and respect.   Your comments to others should be factual, constructive, and free from harassing statements.   You are encouraged to disagree with other students, but such disagreements need to be based upon facts and documentation  (rather than prejudices and personalities). Unprofessional or disrespectful conduct will result in a lower grade on an assignment.   Warnings will not be given; part of the learning process in this course is respectful engagement of ideas with others. Students will need to contribute in intelligent, positive, and constructive manners within the course.   Behaviors that are abusive, disruptive, or harassing may result in disciplinary actions as specified within the Student Rules.  Sensitive or controversial topics might be discussed in this course.   Comments posted within this course are to remain confidential to the audience of this course; do not copy or share messages or writings from this course with others not in this course section. Students in this course are also responsible for being familiar with the Universit y’s student rules and policies

See Make Up & Late Work policy . 
Make Up and Late Work Policy 
See the Makeup Work Policy, the Attendance Policy, the Statement on Mental Health and Wellness, and the COVID-19 
Amendment  under University Policies below.  
It is your responsibility to keep up with the class, even when unexpected events interfere.  
Excused Absences 
Before you can do any make up work, you must provide your instructor  with any documentation for your excused absence.   • Submit any documentation for excused absences online
. 
• Follow up with your instructor after submitting documentation.  
Exam Make Up 
You may only make up exams missed due to a university excused absence. Note that if advanced notice is not feasible, you have two business days to provide notification. See Make Up policy
 under University Policies below.  8 of 13   A zero will be assigned for exams due to an unexcused absence. Documentation must be submitted prior to making up a missed exam.  If you miss an exam due to an excused absence you must take the make up exam on the designated date and time:  • Exam 1 Make Up: Friday, March 11 at 7:00 PM • Exam 2 Make Up: Friday, April 15 at 7:00 PM o If and only if you have a course time conflict, you can make other arrangements with your instructor. zyBook and Quizzes 
zyBooks and Quizzes cannot be made up. It is an indication of what you are currently doing to consistently keep up with course materials. However, excused absences will be considered when determining zyBooks and Quiz averages . 
Homework Late Work 
Homework is not accepted late. Excused absences during the period of  the homework will extend the due date by the number of days excused. After the due date, you can submit a redemption version of the homework  that will be open until the last day of final exams. Your homework grade will be the maximum of your homework scor e submitted on time or the average of your homework score submitted on time and your score on the redemption version of the homework. Note: In the autograding system, you will get the maximum score you earn. This allows to submit a passing version even if you “break” your code while trying to pass more test cases  which commonly happens when trying to improve your score.  Note: Network congestion frequently increases close to deadlines. So,  waiting to submit until the last minute can easily lead to it becoming a late submission. We suggest finishing an assignment several hours in advance to ensure it is on time. You should also submit periodically as you develop your solution to get feedback from the autograding system.  
Labwork Late Work 
You should always complete labwork. If you have an excused absence, then you may complete the labwork on your own. Part of having labwork be collaborative is so you can discuss with others until you both understand the concepts and have a working solution. Feel free to discuss the labwork with a classmate, peer teacher, TA or instructor to ensure you get all of the benefits of completing the labwork.

See Academic Integrity Statement and Policy  under University Policies below. 
Acknowledgement 
By submitting anything to this course, electronically or otherwise, you are asserting the following: “On my honor, as an Aggie, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work. In particular, I certify that I have listed above all the sources that I consulted regarding this assignment, and that I have not received or given any assistance that is contrary to the letter or the spirit of the collaboration guidelines for this assignment.”
Academic Dishonesty 
Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. For individual homework assignments, each student is expected to write his or her own programs from beginning to end. If it is determined to the satisfaction of the instructor that any student's submission (unless it is a group/team submission for a group/team activity) is not the product of the individual, all students involved are subject to the Texas A &M University Honor System Rules, including a course grade of F* (with the ‘*’ denoting academic dishonesty).  Additional penalties as determined by the Aggie Honor System Office may be applied if this is not the first offense.  It is imperative that each student clearly understand those rules and the severe consequences that can result from the adjudication of an Honor Code Violation. 
Plagiarism & Cheating 
Individual programming MUST be done on your own. Plagiarism and cheating will not be tolerated. Plagiarism is the presentation of the work of someone else without giving him or her due credit. In this course, you cannot use another’s work even if you cite it. Cheating is using or attempting to use unauthorized materials. For example, since homework assignments are to be done individually, you are cheating if you discuss it with another student. However discussing it with instructors, peer teachers and TAs is acceptable. You are also copying if you do an online search and find a solution to a homework problem or something very similar to a homework problem. If you copy, you are both plagiarizing and cheating.  To help identify possible instances of plagiarism, we use systems for plagiarism detection. Students engaging in plagiarism will be sanctioned. A typical result is an F in the course and submission of the incident to the Aggie Honor System.  
Complicity 
Every student should understand that complicity – helping or attempting to help another student commit an act of academic dishonesty – also constitutes academic dishonesty and carries the same punishment as cheating and plagiarism. In other words, if you provide your solution to another student, even if that student does not turn it in for credit, you have committed an act of academic dishonesty. All involved will be subject to the same consequences, such as a course grade of F*. 
Collaboration 
Collaboration is important for facilitating learning, and your peers can be a great resource. In this class you can only collaborate on labworks and in class activities. All other assignments and exams must be done independently. If you have an issue that needs clarification, contact an instructor or TA.  
Netiquette 
Netiquette is network etiquette.  Netiquette covers both common courtesy online and the informal interactions that occur when communication occurs online. Faculty and student s are expected to follow some general netiquette rules
 
(https://distance.tamu.edu/Student-Rules-and-Policies/Aggie-Honor-Code-and-Netiquette). Your instructor may introduce additional guidelines as needed. 
Course Copyright 
The materials used within this course are copyrighted.  These materials include, but are not limi ted to, the syllabi, quizzes, exams, homework and labwork problems, online handouts, course videos, audio and visual recordings of classes, etc.  Because these materials are copyrighted, you do not have the right to copy or distribute these materials, unless permission is expressly granted.  
12 of 13   Recording statement 
Students may not record audio or video of any course activity unless the student has an approved accommodation from Disability Services permitting the recording of lectures and/or laboratory sessions.  This accommodation letter must be presented to the instructor in advance of any recording being done.
