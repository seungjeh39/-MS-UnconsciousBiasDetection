documentation by the designated due date.   Both reflection and documentation must be
determined to be acceptable in order to receive an "S" grade in the class. The course

“incomplete.”  Submissions deemed “incomplete” will be returned to the student for
revision and re-submission within 7 days.  Only 1 opportunity for revision will be given. 
A second submission deemed “incomplete” will result in a failing grade of “U.” and the
student will be required to repeat the course.
Submissions deemed “incomplete” will be returned to the student for revision and re-
submission within 7 days.  Only 1 opportunity for revision will be given.  A second
