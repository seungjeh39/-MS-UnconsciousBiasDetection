CSCE 312 Computer Organization  
 Credits 4. 3 Lectur e Hours. 2 Lab Hours  
 Introduction to computer systems from programmer's perspective: simple logic design, data
representation and processor architecture, programming of processors, memory , control ﬂow ,
input/output, and performance measurements; hands-on lab assignments. 
Prerequisites:  CSCE 221 or concurrent enrollment. Junior or senior classiﬁcation or approval of
instructor .
From the professor: 
Think of the computer as an automobile. So far , you have begun to learn how to drive, that is, to
program the computer in a high-level programming language. But what goes on under the hood?
That is, what are the mechanisms underneath the programming language that cause your program to
execute? This class will provide an answer to that question. You will learn a little about digital logic
design. You will learn how simple electronic devices are linked together to form the complex
computer systems we use. You will see how information is represented and how representations can
have an impact on the programs you write. Many of the mysteries behind the sometimes strange
behavior of high-level programming languages will be revealed. You will learn a very low-level9/15/22, 3:26 PM CSCE 312, Spring 2022 Course Information
https://people.engr .tamu.edu/djimenez/classes/312/syllabus.html 2/3programming language called assembly language  that is part of the interface between software and
hardware. You will learn how details of the implementation of the computer , such as the memory
system, can af fect the performance of your programs. When you leave this class, you will have
developed an accurate mental model of the way computers work so that when you write programs in
a high-level language you will have a good idea of what is really going on when your program runs.
Thus, you will become a better programmer .
This class has two big parts: digital logic design and assembly language. Assembly language is the
bigger part so we'll do digital logic design ﬁrst. There are little parts, too, that we'll pick up along the
way.
About The Lab Section  
Your teaching assistant will lead a lab covering the topics presented the lecture. The T A will administer quizzes,
discuss assignments, answer you questions, and in general serve as a resource to give you a better idea of what is
going on in the class than your crazy absent-minded professor can.
Course Requir ements:
Homework Assignments: (25% of grade). We'll have several homework assignments, many requiring
programming.
Quizzes: (20% of grade). There will be quizzes in the lab section.
Midterm exams: (25% of grade). There will be one or two exams during the semester .
Last exam: (30% of grade). There will be a "last" exam near the end of the semester .
Grading
Letter grades will be assigned as follows: A is ≥ 90%; B is ≥ 80%; C is ≥ 70%; D is ≥ 60%; F is < 60%.
Policy on Assignments and T ests
Late assignments are not accepted. If you have not completed an assignment by the time it is due, turn in what
you have for partial credit. Make-up tests are generally not given except for university sanctioned reasons, such
as religious holidays, documented illnesses, catastrophic events, or other grave situations. You must inform the
professor before missing the test. Quizzes may not be made up.
Academic Dishonesty
Unless a programming project or problem set is speciﬁcally assigned as a group project, students are not allowed
to work together on assignments. You may discuss general ideas related to the assignment, but you may not e.g.
share program code or read each others writeups. Instances of such collaboration will be dealt with harshly , but
the real cost comes when a student doesn't know how to answer questions on a test about issues involved in
doing an assignment. In writing assignments, you may not copy or paraphrase work in whole or in part from
other sources without giving proper attribution and making it clear which passages of text are from other sources.
Failure to do so is considered plagiarism.
Academic Integrity Statement
"An Aggie does not lie, cheat, or steal or tolerate those who do." 
 
Upon accepting admission to T exas A&M University , a student immediately assumes a commitment to uphold9/15/22, 3:26 PM CSCE 312, Spring 2022 Course Information
https://people.engr .tamu.edu/djimenez/classes/312/syllabus.html 3/3the Honor Code, to accept responsibility for learning and to follow the philosophy and rules of the Honor
System. Students will be required to state their commitment on examinations, research papers, and other
academic work. Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the T exas A&M University community
from the requirements or the processes of the Honor System. For additional information please visit:
http://www .tamu.edu/aggiehonor . 
On all course work, assignments, and examinations at T exas A&M University , the following Honor Pledge shall
be preprinted and signed by the student: "On my honor , as an Aggie, I have neither given nor r eceived
unauthorized aid on this academic work."
COVID-19 Statement
To help protect Aggieland and stop the spread of COVID-19, T exas A&M University ur ges students to be
vaccinated and to wear masks in classrooms and all other academic facilities on campus, including labs. Doing
so exempliﬁes the Aggie Core V alues of respect, leadership, integrity , and selﬂess service by putting community
concerns above individual preferences. COVID-19 vaccines and masking â€” regardless of vaccination status
â€” have been shown to be safe and ef fective at reducing spread to others, infection, hospitalization, and death.
