Grading Policy
Quizzes: 25 points each (x10, but only top 8 counted)
Homeworks: 20 points each (x13, but lowest three dropped). A subset of each homework will be
graded for correctness. The other problems will be graded for completeness only . Your assignments
must be submitted in LaT eX (see references above). Submit assignment to gradescope
(https://www .gradescope.com)

Regrading Policy
We will make an ef fort to complete the grading of work within one week of the turnin date. If you
believe your work was graded incorrectly or incompletely , you must submit a regrade request in
Gradescope within one week.  Only if you can prove to the grader that your solution is correct and
complete will your work be regraded.
Late W ork/Attendance Policy
Late homeworks are not accepted and are worth 0 points.
Work submitted by a student as makeup work for an excused absence is not considered late work
and is exempted from the late work policy . (See Student Rule 7  (https://student-

University Policies
This section outlines the university level policies. The T AMU Faculty Senate established the wording
of these policies.
 
Attendance Policy
The university views class attendance and participation as an individual student responsibility .
Students are expected to attend class and to complete all assignments.
Please refer to Student Rule 7   (https://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07/) in its entirety for information
about excused absences, including definitions, and related documentation and timelines.

https://texasam.instructure.com/courses/136448/pages/syllabus 6/9Makeup W ork Policy
Students will be excused from attending class on the day of a graded activity or when attendance
contributes to a student’ s grade, for the reasons stated in Student Rule 7, or other reason deemed
appropriate by the instructor .
Please refer to Student Rule 7  (https://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07/) in its entirety for information
about makeup work, including definitions, and related documentation and timelines.
Absences related to T itle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 may necessitate a period of more
than 30 days for make-up work, and the timeframe for make-up work should be agreed upon by the
student and instructor” (Student Rule 7, Section 7.4.1  (https://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07/) ).
“The instructor is under no obligation to provide an opportunity for the student to make up work
missed because of an unexcused absence” (Student Rule 7, Section 7.4.2  (https://student-
rules.tamu.edu/rule07/) ).
Students who request an excused absence are expected to uphold the Aggie Honor Code and
Student Conduct Code. (See Student Rule 24  (https://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule24/) ).
 
Academic Integrity Statement and Policy
“An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal, or tolerate those who do.”
“Texas A&M University students are responsible for authenticating all work submitted to an instructor .
If asked, students must be able to produce proof that the item submitted is indeed the work of that
student. Students must keep appropriate records at all times. The inability to authenticate one’ s work,
should the instructor request it, may be suf ficient grounds to initiate an academic misconduct case”
(Section 20.1.2.3, Student Rule 20  (https://aggiehonor.tamu.edu/Rules-and-
Procedures/Rules/Honor-System-Rules) ).

Disabilities may include, but are not limited to attentional, learning, mental health, sensory , physical,
or chronic health conditions. All students are encouraged to discuss their disability related needs with
Disability Resources and their instructors as soon as possible.

Title IX and Statement on Limits to Confidentiality
Texas A&M University is committed to fostering a learning environment that is safe and productive for
all. University policies and federal and state laws prohibit gender-based discrimination and sexual
harassment, including sexual assault, sexual exploitation, domestic violence, dating violence, and
stalking.
With the exception of some medical and mental health providers, all university employees (including
full and part-time faculty , staf f, paid graduate assistants, student workers, etc.) are Mandatory
Reporters and must report to the T itle IX Of fice if the employee experiences, observes, or becomes
aware of an incident that meets the following conditions  (see University Rule 08.01.01.M1
(https://rules-saps.tamu.edu/PDFs/08.01.01.M1.pdf) ):
The incident is reasonably believed to be discrimination or harassment.
The incident is alleged to have been committed by or against a person who, at the time of the
incident, was (1) a student enrolled at the University or (2) an employee of the University .
Mandatory Reporters must file a report regardless of how the information comes to their attention –
including but not limited to face-to-face conversations, a written class assignment or paper , class
discussion, email, text, or social media post. Although Mandatory Reporters must file a report, in
most instances, a person who is subjected to the alleged conduct will be able to control how the
report is handled, including whether or not to pursue a formal investigation. The University’ s goal is to
make sure you are aware of the range of options available to you and to ensure access to the
resources you need.
Texas A&M at College Station
Students wishing to discuss concerns in a confidential setting are encouraged to make an
appointment with Counseling and Psychological Services  (https://caps.tamu.edu/) (CAPS).
 Students can learn more about filing a report, accessing supportive resources, and navigating the
Title IX investigation and resolution process on the University’ s Title IX webpage
