A: 90 – 100%; B: 80 – 89%; C: 70 – 79%; D: 60 – 69%; F: < 60%.
Attendance – Attendance is recommended due to the constant coverage of information in the course.
The student is responsible for obtaining information from missed classes. Quizzes  will  be given to
students during some classes to allow a better understanding of discussed topics, and some of the
quizzes can be annotated and graded.
Homework – Homework assignments will be placed on Canvas. Homework consist on programming
assignments, as well as their description. Homework due dates are given with assignment. A homework
is turned in class the day it is due. Late is considered after class ends. All late assignments will lose 30%
of their value from the first day to one week after the due date, and no submission will be accepted
after that. Please give proper notice if expected to miss a homework. Make up homework is only
possible with approval given a university excused absence.
Labs – Students will work in teams for each lab exercise. A lab grade is comprised of demonstrating
working  lab  exercises  and  a  lab  report.  One  lab  report  per  group  will  be  submitted.  All
demonstrations of working lab exercises and lab reports are due by the beginning of the next lab.
No late demonstrations or reports will be accepted. A failing lab grade will result in a failing course
grade. If lab cannot be attended, student is required to give notice so that a makeup lab can be given
accordingly. If makeup lab is not completed in a timely manner, a late grade to the lab will be
assigned, and re-submission will be refused.
Exams – Two mid-term exams and a final are given. All exams will be weighted equally. A reference
sheet (if needed) will be given, calculators are allowed during the exam. Mid-terms exams dates
may change depending at the discretion of the instructor. The final exam is based on TAMU finals
schedule. Please give proper notice if expected to miss an exam, or if an exam is missed. Make up
exam is only possible with approval given a university excused absence.

Attendance Policy
The university views class attendance and participation as an individual student responsibility. Students 
are expected to attend class and to complete all assignments. 
Please  refer  to  Student  Rule  7 in  its  entirety  for  information  about  excused  absences,  including
definitions, and related documentation and timelines.

Spring 2022SYLLABUS
Please refer to Student Rule 7 in its entirety for information about makeup work, including definitions, 
and related documentation and timelines.
Absences related to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 may necessitate a period of more
than 30 days for make-up work, and the timeframe for make-up work should be agreed upon by the
student and instructor” ( Student Rule 7, Section 7.4.1 ).
“The instructor is under no obligation to provide an opportunity for the student to make up work missed
because of an unexcused absence” ( Student Rule 7, Section 7.4.2 ).
Students who request an excused absence are expected to uphold the Aggie Honor Code and Student 
Conduct Code. (See Student Rule 24.)
Academic Integrity Statement and Policy
“An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal, or tolerate those who do.”
“Texas A&M University students are responsible for authenticating all work submitted to an instructor. If
asked, students must be able to produce proof that the item submitted is indeed the work of that
student. Students must keep appropriate records at all times. The inability to authenticate one’s work,
should the instructor request it, may be sufficient grounds to initiate an academic misconduct case”
(Section 20.1.2.3, Student Rule 20 ).
You can learn more about the Aggie Honor System Office Rules and Procedures, academic integrity, and
your rights and responsibilities at aggiehonor.tamu.edu .
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Policy
Texas  A&M  University  is  committed  to  providing  equitable  access  to  learning  opportunities  for  all
students. If you experience barriers to your education due to a disability or think you may have a
disability, please contact Disability Resources in the Student Services Building or at (979) 845-1637 or

Title IX and Statement on Limits to Confidentiality
Texas A&M University is committed to fostering a learning environment that is safe and productive for
all.  University  policies  and  federal  and  state  laws  prohibit  gender-based  discrimination  and  sexual
harassment,  including  sexual  assault,  sexual  exploitation,  domestic  violence,  dating  violence,  and
stalking.
Spring 2022SYLLABUS
With the exception of some medical and mental health providers, all university employees (including full
and part-time faculty, staff, paid graduate assistants, student workers, etc.) are Mandatory Reporters 
and must report to the Title IX Office if the employee experiences, observes, or becomes aware of an 
incident that meets the following conditions (see University Rule 08.01.01.M1 ):
The incident is reasonably believed to be discrimination or harassment. 
The incident is alleged to have been committed by or against a person who, at the time of the 
incident, was (1) a student enrolled at the University or (2) an employee of the University. 
Mandatory Reporters must file a report regardless of how the information comes to their attention –
including  but  not  limited  to  face-to-face  conversations,  a  written  class  assignment  or  paper,  class
discussion, email, text, or social media post. Although Mandatory Reporters must file a report, in most
instances, you will be able to control how the report is handled, including whether or not to pursue a
formal investigation. The University’s goal is to make sure you are aware of the range of options
available to you and to ensure access to the resources you need.
Students wishing to discuss concerns in a confidential setting are encouraged to make an appointment 
with Counseling and Psychological Services  (CAPS). 
Students can learn more about filing a report, accessing supportive resources, and navigating the Title IX
investigation and resolution process on the University’s Title   IX webpage  .
Statement on Mental Health and Wellness
Texas A&M University recognizes that mental health and wellness are critical factors that influence a 
student’s academic success and overall wellbeing. Students are encouraged to engage in proper self-
care by utilizing the resources and services available from Counseling & Psychological Services (CAPS). 
Students who need someone to talk to can call the TAMU Helpline (979-845-2700) from 4:00 p.m. to 
8:00 a.m. weekdays and 24 hours on weekends. 24-hour emergency help is also available through the 
National Suicide Prevention Hotline (800-273-8255) or at suicidepreventionlifeline.org . 
COVID-19 Temporary Amendment to Minimum Syllabus Requirements
To help protect Aggieland and stop the spread of COVID-19, Texas A&M University urges students to be
vaccinated and to wear masks in classrooms and all other academic facilities on campus, including labs.
Doing so exemplifies the Aggie Core Values of respect, leadership, integrity, and selfless service by
putting community concerns above individual preferences. COVID-19 vaccines and masking — regardless
of  vaccination  status  —  have  been  shown  to  be  safe  and  effective  at  reducing  spread  to  others,
infection, hospitalization, and death.
